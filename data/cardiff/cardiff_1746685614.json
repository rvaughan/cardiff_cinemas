The production showcases bespoke instruments, including a magnetic harp, a circular flute, an aluphone, and a reverb chamber, and Björk is furthermore joined on stage by musical director and multi-instrumentalist Bergur Þórisson, percussionist Manu Delago, flute septet Viibra, harpist Katie Buckley and the Hamrahlid choir. Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir,

But their chemistry begins to curdle as Violet begins being irritated and then terrorized by a series of anonymous drops to her phone.\n\nShe is instructed to tell nobody and follow instructions or the hooded figure she sees on her home security cameras will kill Violet’s young son and babysitting sister. Violet must do exactly as directed or everyone she loves will die. Her unseen tormentor’s final directive?

Three thousand years ago, the greatest sailors in the world voyaged across the vast South Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, for a millennium, their voyages stopped – and no one today knows why. From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes “Moana,” a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who sails out on a daring mission to save her people. During her journey, Moana (voice of Auliʻi Cravalho) meets the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson), who guides her in her quest to become a master wayfinder. Together, they sail across the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills the ancient quest of her ancestors and discovers the one thing she’s always sought: her own identity.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/MOANA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=Q4jlQd7pgowM5Ryj5mE6nAsNLO6lZMEwGAT2vVh5impsHAs16j5O1luPET%2BCKiVqhvf31nb7QNaXV0PMtO5XT3FHO4miBKE24XMHI4ckwis1W6upPsOtMOJntjoY81GlS5CfWQ8P1awAoI5%2BACpwwn6Athy%2BUJIusmhdffyCWnt2qZdWIRmy%2B4C05afLIDKgW60BZ7fkyxmSKEQE%2BI14VjwdJkLuRKij0lZAB323DhzNwg5A%2Bh6fstUqGlzLzfS3Y2AZyT72p0xZS3TEEPY%2BQfv6eG40h7DAGVvxURz2vTZcJ9wRde%2FnTCdQthhmE9lDqczZKONM54nXbPh8VRFshQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 18 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-18T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295195&lang=en"}]}],"length_in_minutes":108},{"title":"MR BURTON","description":"Based on a remarkable true story, discover how the poor son of a miner became one of the greatest actors the world has ever known, with the help of an unlikely mentor.\n\nIn the Welsh town of Port Talbot, 1942, Richard Jenkins (Harry Lawtey) lives as a wayward schoolboy, caught between the pressures of his struggling family, a devastating war, and his own ambitions.

MCMLXXII","description":"Pink Floyd at Pompeii – MCMLXXII, the groundbreaking 1972 film directed by Adrian Maben, returns to theaters, now digitally re-mastered in 4K from the original 35mm footage with enhanced audio. \nSet in the hauntingly beautiful ruins of the ancient Roman Amphitheater in Pompeii, Italy, the film captures Pink Floyd performing an intimate concert without an audience. Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release.

at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 10 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-10T13:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80143"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 11 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-11T13:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79935"}]}],"length_in_minutes":91},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"SIX The Musical – Live! on the Big Screen at Showcase Cinemas!\n\nWest End sensation Six The Musical is making its way to the big screen, offering audiences a dazzling cinematic experience of the Tony Award-winning production.

Angela and her partner Lee have been unlucky with their IVF treatments, but can’t afford to pay for another round. Meanwhile, their friend Min, the closeted scion of a multinational corporate empire, has plenty of family money but a soon-to-expire student visa. When his commitment-phobic boyfriend Chris rejects his proposal, Min makes the offer to Angela instead: a green card marriage in exchange for funding Lee’s IVF. But their plans to quietly elope are upended when Min’s sceptical grandmother flies in from Korea unannounced, insisting on an all-out wedding extravaganza. With a pitch-perfect cast of multigenerational talent that includes Bowen Yang, Academy Award nominee Lily Gladstone, Kelly Marie Tran, Han Gi-chan, Joan Chen, and Academy Award winner Youn Yuh-jung, this fresh reimagining of Ang Lee’s beloved, Award-winning rom-com teems with humour and heart in a poignant reminder that being part of a family means learning to both accept and forgive.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEWEDDINGBANQUET.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=He5dE8kXzNnhwgM%2B4xEC%2Fqd45pC2nq9SG2eE%2FQm7VDLJ4YPbFRATF7c%2B%2FLdushtCCwJjzWcJH0MBUwgAzaz5UmQUTnY%2BTAVMYlMhUFezejeS%2FAr58KgRC9S541uWK56VHVrqGGF1evmpaLo6XkaEfdKmMDVK0TBGkInACivmWueihCxOOE3b0xGSKPwMW2fBZIXCmZlAaFN8iPamwlrhZ9qgOQXTWEUmP3OoK6TidkmsNN4Tto%2FKq0l8qHNYjRBZRXxjYwK3uHHWLu4jM417TyfzFdGb4P8rH6d5%2FuepK8uzHIk4l9QQFC5AJ8xGp8XuC%2B1AdEXPiufqWHfhNLe7lw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-09T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld

Times+ preview screening of The Salt Path, a moving adaptation of the best-selling memoir by Raynor Winn.\n\nThe Salt Path is the profound true story of husband and wife, Raynor and Moth Winn’s 630-mile trek along the beautiful but rugged Cornish, Devon and Dorset coastline.\n\nAfter being forcibly removed from their home, they make the desperate decision to walk in the hope that, in nature, they will find solace and a sense of acceptance. With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination. The Salt Path is a journey that is exhilarating, challenging, and liberating in equal measure. A portrayal of home, how it can be lost and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.\n\nEach ticket includes a complimentary popcorn.","rating":"12A","image_link":null,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 29 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-29T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41308"}]}],"length_in_minutes":115},{"title":"UNTIL DAWN","description":"One year after her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers.

Trapped in the valley, they’re forced to relive the nightmare again and again - only each time the killer threat is different, each more terrifying than the last.

concert film recorded live in Lisbon, captures the celebrated artist’s groundbreaking tour that mesmerised audiences worldwide for five years.\n\nThis unique cinematic experience immerses viewers in Björk’s spectacular stage production, featuring a setlist spanning her iconic early works to the visionary Utopia (2017) and Fossora (2023). The production showcases bespoke instruments, including a magnetic harp, a circular flute, an aluphone, and a reverb chamber, and Björk is furthermore joined on stage by musical director and multi-instrumentalist Bergur Þórisson, percussionist Manu Delago, flute septet Viibra, harpist Katie Buckley and the Hamrahlid choir. Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton-Jones.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BJ%C3%96RK%3ACORNUCOPIA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=uk23f%2FKtU2kDFftu9tL01hL1J%2BBDmugvxZ2w2MOj%2FETtyCqnZzKEUbEFQEMRTFxdamo%2BC8hr8qjgGa39f%2BK%2BfgAQUWa9gYWT%2BBtV25%2BvtjkgJaJny62SEk%2BIgOX4aO0yLOZyhiZJZ3gR8x1WJQ7o0mPkNeFFlX8Nd%2Bars4juDUmDPf9bKBR%2FRg9BFJP7IaFXlHWok3nA06L8VtWxUdXjcGVwFKuOafBnqHnd3kkTA6t%2BRXQwpVMgNZ0GyaIzrJO1SkdstaoCNradjlJZeuWSow418mbMEocQC0Rupxci%2BQ8k4TCImNYEiIMaHOMAYSxx3gIE%2B%2BgirJS%2BDFWDxNg85w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":120,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-09T18:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41258"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET'S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BLUEYATTHECINEMA%3ALET%27SPLAYCHEFCOLLECTION.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=XeUJkQAKwHap64%2B1fPswL%2FAIsa0Tz6uFuYJ0fgRAoKVMEKtR5KhkyTsgMdfKQc1cUGU9YbVDewwsHMKYJGmyg2CvoAwZOaHbog9T%2FaFOGDp0zbU0qXCu6CAcDHWw9rYtqHh8RIipn4s42SZn8qLtDWUJsyolJp5grX9fExaKRoSzrd6UWl9oJPp6B58gWeSAlpE%2F%2FysE%2B8pUPY5m708y7IYeDxsU0gwC269zjgLHgD%2Bvfl9A0tWjyVIRCWdyBzMTtbfEVGscWPUVLxyQKJzeasS8DkLlmM8ZoNUPfcJ1yTE5WeQB5z9pDS%2FCJJw23zPwCpgtaQpk2exbdrCdVdMffQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":60,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-09T12:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295503&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET’S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"Bluey at the Cinema: Let’s Play Chef Collection is an hour-long treat for fans of Bluey to enjoy, made up of eight episodes from the TV show’s three series, all based around the fun of food!

Meanwhile, their friend Min, the closeted scion of a multinational corporate empire, has plenty of family money but a soon-to-expire student visa. When his commitment-phobic boyfriend Chris rejects his proposal, Min makes the offer to Angela instead: a green card marriage in exchange for funding Lee’s IVF. But their plans to quietly elope are upended when Min’s sceptical grandmother flies in from Korea unannounced, insisting on an all-out wedding extravaganza. With a pitch-perfect cast of multigenerational talent that includes Bowen Yang, Academy Award nominee Lily Gladstone, Kelly Marie Tran, Han Gi-chan, Joan Chen, and Academy Award winner Youn Yuh-jung, this fresh reimagining of Ang Lee’s beloved, Award-winning rom-com teems with humour and heart in a poignant reminder that being part of a family means learning to both accept and forgive.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEWEDDINGBANQUET.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=He5dE8kXzNnhwgM%2B4xEC%2Fqd45pC2nq9SG2eE%2FQm7VDLJ4YPbFRATF7c%2B%2FLdushtCCwJjzWcJH0MBUwgAzaz5UmQUTnY%2BTAVMYlMhUFezejeS%2FAr58KgRC9S541uWK56VHVrqGGF1evmpaLo6XkaEfdKmMDVK0TBGkInACivmWueihCxOOE3b0xGSKPwMW2fBZIXCmZlAaFN8iPamwlrhZ9qgOQXTWEUmP3OoK6TidkmsNN4Tto%2FKq0l8qHNYjRBZRXxjYwK3uHHWLu4jM417TyfzFdGb4P8rH6d5%2FuepK8uzHIk4l9QQFC5AJ8xGp8XuC%2B1AdEXPiufqWHfhNLe7lw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":103,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-09T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295430&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-09T14:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80079"},{"time":"2025-05-09T16:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295431&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-09T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80083"},{"time":"2025-05-09T19:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295432&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"THUDARUM","description":"Thudarum is a heartwarming Malayalam family-comedy film directed by Tharun Moorthy.

concert film recorded live in Lisbon, captures the celebrated artist’s groundbreaking tour that mesmerised audiences worldwide for five years.\n\nThis unique cinematic experience immerses viewers in Björk’s spectacular stage production, featuring a setlist spanning her iconic early works to the visionary Utopia (2017) and Fossora (2023). The production showcases bespoke instruments, including a magnetic harp, a circular flute, an aluphone, and a reverb chamber, and Björk is furthermore joined on stage by musical director and multi-instrumentalist Bergur Þórisson, percussionist Manu Delago, flute septet Viibra, harpist Katie Buckley and the Hamrahlid choir. Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton-Jones.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BJ%C3%96RK%3ACORNUCOPIA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=uk23f%2FKtU2kDFftu9tL01hL1J%2BBDmugvxZ2w2MOj%2FETtyCqnZzKEUbEFQEMRTFxdamo%2BC8hr8qjgGa39f%2BK%2BfgAQUWa9gYWT%2BBtV25%2BvtjkgJaJny62SEk%2BIgOX4aO0yLOZyhiZJZ3gR8x1WJQ7o0mPkNeFFlX8Nd%2Bars4juDUmDPf9bKBR%2FRg9BFJP7IaFXlHWok3nA06L8VtWxUdXjcGVwFKuOafBnqHnd3kkTA6t%2BRXQwpVMgNZ0GyaIzrJO1SkdstaoCNradjlJZeuWSow418mbMEocQC0Rupxci%2BQ8k4TCImNYEiIMaHOMAYSxx3gIE%2B%2BgirJS%2BDFWDxNg85w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":120,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 10 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-10T12:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41254"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET'S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BLUEYATTHECINEMA%3ALET%27SPLAYCHEFCOLLECTION.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=XeUJkQAKwHap64%2B1fPswL%2FAIsa0Tz6uFuYJ0fgRAoKVMEKtR5KhkyTsgMdfKQc1cUGU9YbVDewwsHMKYJGmyg2CvoAwZOaHbog9T%2FaFOGDp0zbU0qXCu6CAcDHWw9rYtqHh8RIipn4s42SZn8qLtDWUJsyolJp5grX9fExaKRoSzrd6UWl9oJPp6B58gWeSAlpE%2F%2FysE%2B8pUPY5m708y7IYeDxsU0gwC269zjgLHgD%2Bvfl9A0tWjyVIRCWdyBzMTtbfEVGscWPUVLxyQKJzeasS8DkLlmM8ZoNUPfcJ1yTE5WeQB5z9pDS%2FCJJw23zPwCpgtaQpk2exbdrCdVdMffQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":60,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 10 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-10T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295490&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-10T13:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295529&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET’S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"Bluey at the Cinema: Let’s Play Chef Collection is an hour-long treat for fans of Bluey to enjoy, made up of eight episodes from the TV show’s three series, all based around the fun of food!

features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 10 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-10T13:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80143"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Originally recorded at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens.","rating":"12a","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 10 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-10T08:45:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020097/288086","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}]},{"title":"SUBHAM","description":"Quirky comedy entertainer","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SUBHAM.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KNdjF8PwgFedjxNT5z7utSca%2BX2fvtsQCQAv7y8FkDoWCV%2F4zfjBlPItkRvl%2F7UCGLHXmXzRCw%2FjQ6O1Pwa8h%2FkLxQXw1ncFYb9gsn57hZPot6J1zupk1LvipxQXZSkB4BTl%2BvnTRDiWhRqxE2zP16JSpFje9AA9mbrOZER28WRHDXuWXb2Bx2FyVCl3MGdqPn0Ox8nFiJsayv2iq%2Fd6z315BScBxMTo4EcYiXj10KjilOrSO8J8WotBE%2BuDYdZa150%2FenjIybcafiUhKsrLnheL51%2F9VnvFkhZ51%2BCF6mRzzdPbWsUyw4UFZ5LPYS1YvRWpJQM6RdrNc%2FNyzDoINw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":125,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 10 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-10T19:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295608&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"SYLVANIAN FAMILIES","description":"","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SYLVANIANFAMILIES.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KK14VvngB4jpAG%2FJan37T02MgOL8oT8mNoZ%2B7qs76on%2BcTIsqmoExh%2Fyxaq2J9K%2B3u8cCmAbaPd%2FLaDbQE%2FNv6cMp6ygiEFRRrflUmq38Tnn96I%2BZ3l8eiBQ3Gg%2FSm0rvkrmpVEhzVUwrB%2FuyDppXSBVLsgYgwhzHEv%2BK%2BncAPgtrSY1Eow%2BNSbURvK0Xi5oK58jJJtfK66zHahUzy8%2BgbPVvfDhSMItIZ8RDkv45H4A8aFmFOKkdxD7WKJ0Btkja9kuzLds9qdK9Q9KNj6Ep3d0Q5siHQeCeD5sOjWiCxs6yNJHz1H8lucJRrTtBCCv9pcOvQBkihUggUgq5J1CDA%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":66,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 10 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-10T09:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295717&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"SYLVANIAN FAMILIES: THE MOVIE","description":"The annual Star Festival arrives in Sylvanian Village again this year.

a chosen family navigating the disasters and delights of family expectations, queerness, and cultural identity. Angela and her partner Lee have been unlucky with their IVF treatments, but can’t afford to pay for another round. Meanwhile, their friend Min, the closeted scion of a multinational corporate empire, has plenty of family money but a soon-to-expire student visa. When his commitment-phobic boyfriend Chris rejects his proposal, Min makes the offer to Angela instead: a green card marriage in exchange for funding Lee’s IVF. But their plans to quietly elope are upended when Min’s sceptical grandmother flies in from Korea unannounced, insisting on an all-out wedding extravaganza. With a pitch-perfect cast of multigenerational talent that includes Bowen Yang, Academy Award nominee Lily Gladstone, Kelly Marie Tran, Han Gi-chan, Joan Chen, and Academy Award winner Youn Yuh-jung, this fresh reimagining of Ang Lee’s beloved, Award-winning rom-com teems with humour and heart in a poignant reminder that being part of a family means learning to both accept and forgive.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEWEDDINGBANQUET.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=He5dE8kXzNnhwgM%2B4xEC%2Fqd45pC2nq9SG2eE%2FQm7VDLJ4YPbFRATF7c%2B%2FLdushtCCwJjzWcJH0MBUwgAzaz5UmQUTnY%2BTAVMYlMhUFezejeS%2FAr58KgRC9S541uWK56VHVrqGGF1evmpaLo6XkaEfdKmMDVK0TBGkInACivmWueihCxOOE3b0xGSKPwMW2fBZIXCmZlAaFN8iPamwlrhZ9qgOQXTWEUmP3OoK6TidkmsNN4Tto%2FKq0l8qHNYjRBZRXxjYwK3uHHWLu4jM417TyfzFdGb4P8rH6d5%2FuepK8uzHIk4l9QQFC5AJ8xGp8XuC%2B1AdEXPiufqWHfhNLe7lw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":103,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 10 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-10T11:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295445&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-10T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295433&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-10T14:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79891"},{"time":"2025-05-10T16:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295434&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-10T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79893"},{"time":"2025-05-10T19:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295435&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"THE WILD ROBOT","description":"The Wild Robot” follows Rozzum 7134 (“Roz” for short), a futuristic robot that washes ashore on a deserted island.

Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton-Jones.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BJ%C3%96RK%3ACORNUCOPIA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=uk23f%2FKtU2kDFftu9tL01hL1J%2BBDmugvxZ2w2MOj%2FETtyCqnZzKEUbEFQEMRTFxdamo%2BC8hr8qjgGa39f%2BK%2BfgAQUWa9gYWT%2BBtV25%2BvtjkgJaJny62SEk%2BIgOX4aO0yLOZyhiZJZ3gR8x1WJQ7o0mPkNeFFlX8Nd%2Bars4juDUmDPf9bKBR%2FRg9BFJP7IaFXlHWok3nA06L8VtWxUdXjcGVwFKuOafBnqHnd3kkTA6t%2BRXQwpVMgNZ0GyaIzrJO1SkdstaoCNradjlJZeuWSow418mbMEocQC0Rupxci%2BQ8k4TCImNYEiIMaHOMAYSxx3gIE%2B%2BgirJS%2BDFWDxNg85w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":120,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 11 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-11T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41306"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET'S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BLUEYATTHECINEMA%3ALET%27SPLAYCHEFCOLLECTION.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=XeUJkQAKwHap64%2B1fPswL%2FAIsa0Tz6uFuYJ0fgRAoKVMEKtR5KhkyTsgMdfKQc1cUGU9YbVDewwsHMKYJGmyg2CvoAwZOaHbog9T%2FaFOGDp0zbU0qXCu6CAcDHWw9rYtqHh8RIipn4s42SZn8qLtDWUJsyolJp5grX9fExaKRoSzrd6UWl9oJPp6B58gWeSAlpE%2F%2FysE%2B8pUPY5m708y7IYeDxsU0gwC269zjgLHgD%2Bvfl9A0tWjyVIRCWdyBzMTtbfEVGscWPUVLxyQKJzeasS8DkLlmM8ZoNUPfcJ1yTE5WeQB5z9pDS%2FCJJw23zPwCpgtaQpk2exbdrCdVdMffQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":60,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 11 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-11T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295491&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET’S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"Bluey at the Cinema: Let’s Play Chef Collection is an hour-long treat for fans of Bluey to enjoy, made up of eight episodes from the TV show’s three series, all based around the fun of food!

Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 11 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-11T13:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79935"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Originally recorded at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens.","rating":"12a","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 11 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-11T13:15:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020097/288065","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}]},{"title":"SYLVANIAN FAMILIES","description":"","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SYLVANIANFAMILIES.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KK14VvngB4jpAG%2FJan37T02MgOL8oT8mNoZ%2B7qs76on%2BcTIsqmoExh%2Fyxaq2J9K%2B3u8cCmAbaPd%2FLaDbQE%2FNv6cMp6ygiEFRRrflUmq38Tnn96I%2BZ3l8eiBQ3Gg%2FSm0rvkrmpVEhzVUwrB%2FuyDppXSBVLsgYgwhzHEv%2BK%2BncAPgtrSY1Eow%2BNSbURvK0Xi5oK58jJJtfK66zHahUzy8%2BgbPVvfDhSMItIZ8RDkv45H4A8aFmFOKkdxD7WKJ0Btkja9kuzLds9qdK9Q9KNj6Ep3d0Q5siHQeCeD5sOjWiCxs6yNJHz1H8lucJRrTtBCCv9pcOvQBkihUggUgq5J1CDA%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":66,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 11 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-11T09:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295718&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"SYLVANIAN FAMILIES: THE MOVIE","description":"The annual Star Festival arrives in Sylvanian Village again this year.

Angela and her partner Lee have been unlucky with their IVF treatments, but can’t afford to pay for another round. Meanwhile, their friend Min, the closeted scion of a multinational corporate empire, has plenty of family money but a soon-to-expire student visa. When his commitment-phobic boyfriend Chris rejects his proposal, Min makes the offer to Angela instead: a green card marriage in exchange for funding Lee’s IVF. But their plans to quietly elope are upended when Min’s sceptical grandmother flies in from Korea unannounced, insisting on an all-out wedding extravaganza. With a pitch-perfect cast of multigenerational talent that includes Bowen Yang, Academy Award nominee Lily Gladstone, Kelly Marie Tran, Han Gi-chan, Joan Chen, and Academy Award winner Youn Yuh-jung, this fresh reimagining of Ang Lee’s beloved, Award-winning rom-com teems with humour and heart in a poignant reminder that being part of a family means learning to both accept and forgive.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEWEDDINGBANQUET.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=He5dE8kXzNnhwgM%2B4xEC%2Fqd45pC2nq9SG2eE%2FQm7VDLJ4YPbFRATF7c%2B%2FLdushtCCwJjzWcJH0MBUwgAzaz5UmQUTnY%2BTAVMYlMhUFezejeS%2FAr58KgRC9S541uWK56VHVrqGGF1evmpaLo6XkaEfdKmMDVK0TBGkInACivmWueihCxOOE3b0xGSKPwMW2fBZIXCmZlAaFN8iPamwlrhZ9qgOQXTWEUmP3OoK6TidkmsNN4Tto%2FKq0l8qHNYjRBZRXxjYwK3uHHWLu4jM417TyfzFdGb4P8rH6d5%2FuepK8uzHIk4l9QQFC5AJ8xGp8XuC%2B1AdEXPiufqWHfhNLe7lw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":103,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 11 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-11T11:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295446&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-11T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295436&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-11T14:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79940"},{"time":"2025-05-11T16:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295437&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-11T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79946"},{"time":"2025-05-11T19:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295438&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"THE WILD ROBOT","description":"The Wild Robot” follows Rozzum 7134 (“Roz” for short), a futuristic robot that washes ashore on a deserted island.

Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release. Inspired by the golden warmth of Pompeii’s iconic setting, the remaster transforms this timeless piece into a masterpiece of sight and sound.

a joyful comedy of errors about a chosen family navigating the disasters and delights of family expectations, queerness, and cultural identity. Angela and her partner Lee have been unlucky with their IVF treatments, but can’t afford to pay for another round. Meanwhile, their friend Min, the closeted scion of a multinational corporate empire, has plenty of family money but a soon-to-expire student visa. When his commitment-phobic boyfriend Chris rejects his proposal, Min makes the offer to Angela instead: a green card marriage in exchange for funding Lee’s IVF. But their plans to quietly elope are upended when Min’s sceptical grandmother flies in from Korea unannounced, insisting on an all-out wedding extravaganza. With a pitch-perfect cast of multigenerational talent that includes Bowen Yang, Academy Award nominee Lily Gladstone, Kelly Marie Tran, Han Gi-chan, Joan Chen, and Academy Award winner Youn Yuh-jung, this fresh reimagining of Ang Lee’s beloved, Award-winning rom-com teems with humour and heart in a poignant reminder that being part of a family means learning to both accept and forgive.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEWEDDINGBANQUET.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=He5dE8kXzNnhwgM%2B4xEC%2Fqd45pC2nq9SG2eE%2FQm7VDLJ4YPbFRATF7c%2B%2FLdushtCCwJjzWcJH0MBUwgAzaz5UmQUTnY%2BTAVMYlMhUFezejeS%2FAr58KgRC9S541uWK56VHVrqGGF1evmpaLo6XkaEfdKmMDVK0TBGkInACivmWueihCxOOE3b0xGSKPwMW2fBZIXCmZlAaFN8iPamwlrhZ9qgOQXTWEUmP3OoK6TidkmsNN4Tto%2FKq0l8qHNYjRBZRXxjYwK3uHHWLu4jM417TyfzFdGb4P8rH6d5%2FuepK8uzHIk4l9QQFC5AJ8xGp8XuC%2B1AdEXPiufqWHfhNLe7lw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":103,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 12 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-12T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295439&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-12T14:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79977"},{"time":"2025-05-12T16:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295440&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-12T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79972"},{"time":"2025-05-12T19:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295441&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"THUDARUM","description":"Thudarum is a heartwarming Malayalam family-comedy film directed by Tharun Moorthy.

Angela and her partner Lee have been unlucky with their IVF treatments, but can’t afford to pay for another round. Meanwhile, their friend Min, the closeted scion of a multinational corporate empire, has plenty of family money but a soon-to-expire student visa. When his commitment-phobic boyfriend Chris rejects his proposal, Min makes the offer to Angela instead: a green card marriage in exchange for funding Lee’s IVF. But their plans to quietly elope are upended when Min’s sceptical grandmother flies in from Korea unannounced, insisting on an all-out wedding extravaganza.

Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release.

Angela and her partner Lee have been unlucky with their IVF treatments, but can’t afford to pay for another round. Meanwhile, their friend Min, the closeted scion of a multinational corporate empire, has plenty of family money but a soon-to-expire student visa. When his commitment-phobic boyfriend Chris rejects his proposal, Min makes the offer to Angela instead: a green card marriage in exchange for funding Lee’s IVF. But their plans to quietly elope are upended when Min’s sceptical grandmother flies in from Korea unannounced, insisting on an all-out wedding extravaganza. With a pitch-perfect cast of multigenerational talent that includes Bowen Yang, Academy Award nominee Lily Gladstone, Kelly Marie Tran, Han Gi-chan, Joan Chen, and Academy Award winner Youn Yuh-jung, this fresh reimagining of Ang Lee’s beloved, Award-winning rom-com teems with humour and heart in a poignant reminder that being part of a family means learning to both accept and forgive.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEWEDDINGBANQUET.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=He5dE8kXzNnhwgM%2B4xEC%2Fqd45pC2nq9SG2eE%2FQm7VDLJ4YPbFRATF7c%2B%2FLdushtCCwJjzWcJH0MBUwgAzaz5UmQUTnY%2BTAVMYlMhUFezejeS%2FAr58KgRC9S541uWK56VHVrqGGF1evmpaLo6XkaEfdKmMDVK0TBGkInACivmWueihCxOOE3b0xGSKPwMW2fBZIXCmZlAaFN8iPamwlrhZ9qgOQXTWEUmP3OoK6TidkmsNN4Tto%2FKq0l8qHNYjRBZRXxjYwK3uHHWLu4jM417TyfzFdGb4P8rH6d5%2FuepK8uzHIk4l9QQFC5AJ8xGp8XuC%2B1AdEXPiufqWHfhNLe7lw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":103,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 14 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-14T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295645&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-14T14:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80049"},{"time":"2025-05-14T16:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295646&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-14T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80050"},{"time":"2025-05-14T19:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295647&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-14T19:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80095"}]}]},{"title":"THUDARUM","description":"Thudarum is a heartwarming Malayalam family-comedy film directed by Tharun Moorthy.

Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release. Inspired by the golden warmth of Pompeii’s iconic setting, the remaster transforms this timeless piece into a masterpiece of sight and sound.

a joyful comedy of errors about a chosen family navigating the disasters and delights of family expectations, queerness, and cultural identity. Angela and her partner Lee have been unlucky with their IVF treatments, but can’t afford to pay for another round. Meanwhile, their friend Min, the closeted scion of a multinational corporate empire, has plenty of family money but a soon-to-expire student visa. When his commitment-phobic boyfriend Chris rejects his proposal, Min makes the offer to Angela instead: a green card marriage in exchange for funding Lee’s IVF. But their plans to quietly elope are upended when Min’s sceptical grandmother flies in from Korea unannounced, insisting on an all-out wedding extravaganza. With a pitch-perfect cast of multigenerational talent that includes Bowen Yang, Academy Award nominee Lily Gladstone, Kelly Marie Tran, Han Gi-chan, Joan Chen, and Academy Award winner Youn Yuh-jung, this fresh reimagining of Ang Lee’s beloved, Award-winning rom-com teems with humour and heart in a poignant reminder that being part of a family means learning to both accept and forgive.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEWEDDINGBANQUET.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=He5dE8kXzNnhwgM%2B4xEC%2Fqd45pC2nq9SG2eE%2FQm7VDLJ4YPbFRATF7c%2B%2FLdushtCCwJjzWcJH0MBUwgAzaz5UmQUTnY%2BTAVMYlMhUFezejeS%2FAr58KgRC9S541uWK56VHVrqGGF1evmpaLo6XkaEfdKmMDVK0TBGkInACivmWueihCxOOE3b0xGSKPwMW2fBZIXCmZlAaFN8iPamwlrhZ9qgOQXTWEUmP3OoK6TidkmsNN4Tto%2FKq0l8qHNYjRBZRXxjYwK3uHHWLu4jM417TyfzFdGb4P8rH6d5%2FuepK8uzHIk4l9QQFC5AJ8xGp8XuC%2B1AdEXPiufqWHfhNLe7lw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":103,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 15 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-15T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295648&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-15T14:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80059"},{"time":"2025-05-15T16:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295649&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-15T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80058"},{"time":"2025-05-15T19:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295650&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"THUDARUM","description":"Thudarum is a heartwarming Malayalam family-comedy film directed by Tharun Moorthy.

During her journey, Moana (voice of Auliʻi Cravalho) meets the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson), who guides her in her quest to become a master wayfinder. Together, they sail across the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills the ancient quest of her ancestors and discovers the one thing she’s always sought: her own identity.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/MOANA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=Q4jlQd7pgowM5Ryj5mE6nAsNLO6lZMEwGAT2vVh5impsHAs16j5O1luPET%2BCKiVqhvf31nb7QNaXV0PMtO5XT3FHO4miBKE24XMHI4ckwis1W6upPsOtMOJntjoY81GlS5CfWQ8P1awAoI5%2BACpwwn6Athy%2BUJIusmhdffyCWnt2qZdWIRmy%2B4C05afLIDKgW60BZ7fkyxmSKEQE%2BI14VjwdJkLuRKij0lZAB323DhzNwg5A%2Bh6fstUqGlzLzfS3Y2AZyT72p0xZS3TEEPY%2BQfv6eG40h7DAGVvxURz2vTZcJ9wRde%2FnTCdQthhmE9lDqczZKONM54nXbPh8VRFshQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":108,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 18 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-18T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295195&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"PADDINGTON","description":"Discover Paddington in 4DX for the very first time on Sunday May 18 at Cineworld’s 4DX Family Day and grab a 4DX Ticket for just £4/€4 per person.

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37640"}]}]},{"title":"FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES","description":"Plagued by a violent recurring nightmare, college student Stefanie heads home to track down the one person who might be able to break the cycle and save her family...","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINALDESTINATION%3ABLOODLINES.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=l%2FsjVbf7vE2Ss5pYF67BFFuBa%2B3zu3mA9r7tCnWb2WUNUAjMPMsfeQxfo1mGGDSQ8f1IPqUqrZht4ONDgwqwegBGT6Pwhs%2Bp9XIrv3ER%2FthXRzoWkiaZ4Fg%2B80lXPSZMfnD%2B7GkGbZRFQRS0eWLWMSD%2FWqiCKsIUUYf7T7Xm5v%2BtMrG8aiPUpatrgJUkdFUf26YbeXdXEgpZD7stU%2BTJLOYkjExWfl4xT3rfU3kWLVz6nO8ZvdCAztyjPTtf4kwPurR7sXcikc6WgF3XjI9ZknSTWNX4tdaqtQsoEHnAy1SsJtACdvnonde3cutBLiyw77vVFUQpVOMNWTCM1jYOuQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":110,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152240"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T11:20:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152336"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T13:10:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152239"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152335"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T15:50:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152238"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T16:35:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152338"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T19:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152337"}]}]},{"title":"HURRY UP TOMORROW","description":"A musician struggling with the strain of touring connects with an enigmatic fan in this US drama.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HURRYUPTOMORROW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=UwtODgApXL9uf%2Fqk5jMSWOGQhiahZFXSKJJ7oPTnPnvN4TETSQtEodQGN7j%2FrpvYeQ6KDsFBLaYr8M0EBT3mNbHktSzrakKB1fYQKhg42QDHTnjo7PmYRCjAT93jB1A%2B6d7fNkW%2FmfX1r1kadKlRSBrLL9rQRxWVeSOkSTTUkd%2F4oXavGhKsp%2FqdQl%2BpmlGwo9sEUQeLlcYoD5oHyClpKpdx%2FStWpBhk97zFp%2B8DMSkcXrPBZQuELi2Jd%2FJXITSUrNYFhxgl3owrwxvd19A44fIgVAhwWcjlHA2FMcklvozxtF82LgnlvQfb1%2FXt%2FHH7q0H1KtzRZQHAy9rmCXHjcw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":105,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T15:40:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151840"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T18:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151841"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T20:50:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151839"}]}]},{"title":"JAFAICAN + Q&A WITH PETER ANDRE AND FREDI NWAKA","description":"Gazza, a small-time crook, seeks £35,000 for his gran's care.

Leading the company’s first new production of the work in 20 years, Claus Guth, one of Europe’s leading opera directors, gives the biblical story a psychologically perceptive Victorian-era setting. South African soprano Elza van den Heever leads a celebrated cast as the abused and unhinged antiheroine, with Swedish baritone Peter Mattei as the imprisoned prophet Jochanaan; German tenor Gerhard Siegel as Salome’s lecherous stepfather, King Herod; American mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung as his wife, Herodias; and Polish tenor Piotr Buszewski as Narraboth.

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU

With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination. The Salt Path is a journey that is exhilarating, challenging, and liberating in equal measure. A portrayal of home, how it can be lost and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.\n\nEach ticket includes a complimentary popcorn.","rating":"12A","image_link":null,"length_in_minutes":115,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 29 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-29T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41308"}]}]}]},{"tab_date_label":"FRI 30 MAY","film_data":[{"title":"LILO & STITCH","description":"“Lilo & Stitch” is the wildly funny and touching story of a lonely Hawaiian girl and the fugitive alien who helps to mend her broken family.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/LILO%26STITCH.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=Djb4giF4hcIMNGblpm2HJCVBxmPuI9wFtP%2FzxhRxonkAbxj%2BlMzcVpLU209ECSe13%2Bxm263UgSmi5qPU%2FMIhhz9fYvzYS9YIDPwILXpVhz9cueojdkq3mVi0iRvrSHd5ta458QUH5qEu8UWGPj5fw5hxoAkQxAVtNzFm7z%2FcBsfknnLrLIB34YTs2gWaogRi2djSVMN07j72WQTHxGvtVkTdJJQwV6EAKL74KNVvkOyCJaZUcATeXqL%2BVqDVbY5DqdCQY32W%2Bs2U22QNKYqWoP6%2Btqhl%2Bfelt9lb59iYMICc4Hxg8oRn32oMPsnlqb7O03mxqnuQ%2BO8Jp7M6mZSsmQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":110,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 30 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-30T10:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80150"},{"time":"2025-05-30T13:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80160"},{"time":"2025-05-30T16:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80170"},{"time":"2025-05-30T18:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80179"}]}]},{"title":"MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - THE FINAL RECKONING","description":"Our lives are the sum of our choices.
