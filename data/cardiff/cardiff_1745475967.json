The production showcases bespoke instruments, including a magnetic harp, a circular flute, an aluphone, and a reverb chamber, and Björk is furthermore joined on stage by musical director and multi-instrumentalist Bergur Þórisson, percussionist Manu Delago, flute septet Viibra, harpist Katie Buckley and the Hamrahlid choir. Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton-Jones.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BJ%C3%96RK%3ACORNUCOPIA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=uk23f%2FKtU2kDFftu9tL01hL1J%2BBDmugvxZ2w2MOj%2FETtyCqnZzKEUbEFQEMRTFxdamo%2BC8hr8qjgGa39f%2BK%2BfgAQUWa9gYWT%2BBtV25%2BvtjkgJaJny62SEk%2BIgOX4aO0yLOZyhiZJZ3gR8x1WJQ7o0mPkNeFFlX8Nd%2Bars4juDUmDPf9bKBR%2FRg9BFJP7IaFXlHWok3nA06L8VtWxUdXjcGVwFKuOafBnqHnd3kkTA6t%2BRXQwpVMgNZ0GyaIzrJO1SkdstaoCNradjlJZeuWSow418mbMEocQC0Rupxci%2BQ8k4TCImNYEiIMaHOMAYSxx3gIE%2B%2BgirJS%2BDFWDxNg85w%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 07 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-07T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40397"},{"time":"2025-05-07T18:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40201"}]}],"length_in_minutes":120},{"title":"BLACK BAG","description":"Black Bag is an American spy thriller from Academy Award winning director Steven Soderbergh.

Drop is jointly produced by blockbuster genre houses Blumhouse and Platinum Dunes.\n\nEmmy nominee Meghann Fahy, breakout star of White Lotus and The Perfect Couple, plays Violet, a widowed mother on her first date in years, who arrives at an upscale restaurant where she is relieved that her date, Henry (It Ends with Us’ Brandon Sklenar) is more charming and handsome than she expected. But their chemistry begins to curdle as Violet begins being irritated and then terrorized by a series of anonymous drops to her phone.\n\nShe is instructed to tell nobody and follow instructions or the hooded figure she sees on her home security cameras will kill Violet’s young son and babysitting sister. Violet must do exactly as directed or everyone she loves will die. Her unseen tormentor’s final directive? Kill Henry.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/DROP.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=cqV3H4bMBe85fMEaPiT0pHHdUZNhQXsheMUoO50b%2BDtdb88vFMEf6l0Uxkp6fCp9nUm5ZFDQVrTkfilhPHVJCfXusO4wSwvwWqzXOtL681Udfvv6PGsgIkUyf1YpZi7fkl%2FdObDqdiXnmvwzQHNQJWzJ%2FSZHAQrHtbJwsXT5HT%2B3w5HD1JYC0mYfS98SOtoe%2BeBVgifjLDVHxSmGfXWUZ0qXHsyNVOG35pSr9I4kmGwBYy4f31Vjevq8pZhWF2XPrjTj3%2FRHq0qM%2BrvhN%2BLMZfH%2BiNeAO58TQZWiduUm85AWCiVf8MDvhrwtkgtqco6hd%2Bt%2ByjICDrOytzczusfCVQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-24T12:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld

spectacular sculptures and paintings of Michelangelo seem so familiar to us, but what do we really know about this Renaissance giant? Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37640"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37639"}]}],"length_in_minutes":91},{"title":"FLOW","description":"OSCAR & BAFTA Winner 2025: Flow | This visually stunning and poetic feature wins an Academy Award and a BAFTA, celebrated for its unique storytelling and artistic vision.\n\nA wondrous journey, through realms natural and mystical, Flow follows a courageous cat after his home is devastated by a great flood.

Max Webster (Life of Pi) directs this hilarious story of identity, impersonation and romance, filmed live from the National Theatre in London.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/NTLIVE%3ATHEIMPORTANCEOFBEINGEARNEST.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ZHkFl3gjVKy5%2BngwaSBDUbyzFKqzssimtbxdcZmMfER1P%2FOAhpAvvMNe%2BybvLBSew%2F09OV%2BlMEahUBuxMe2x78t4i9F7SnZ0mxcEkBIZo1KOOeuoKOAWhO7XJeQfIdc6w0tNvm66nhZvR4%2F7ptUTlwKc2R8lwyQcLfa2WimiQjaYGoVGVILv%2BxSUdWCNRwih5K625eYYZcZoIT3ixtADTVGX9Y67HLwcjPNRwHnDYx3g2WzG%2F3g6L8KiXJFx7zaDhOIAQeuGQi8uzhewXoeVjlzneETA%2FCJgMCMx2ISVhUYLVUPD7BPdzK0%2B7vUfXqRfxn33pVNEXth%2BTfcmnyeh2Q%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 12 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-12T18:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78487"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 15 MAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-15T13:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148493"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-15T18:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148471"},{"time":"2025-05-15T18:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293278&lang=en"}]}],"length_in_minutes":170},{"title":"OCEAN WITH DAVID ATTENBOROUGH","description":"OCEAN WITH DAVID ATTENBOROUGH takes viewers on a breathtaking journey showing there is nowhere more vital for our survival, more full of life, wonder, or surprise, than the ocean.\n\nThe celebrated broadcaster and filmmaker reveals how his lifetime has coincided with the great age of ocean discovery.

Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos.

Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n Watched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-24T10:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294218&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-24T11:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78890"},{"time":"2025-04-24T12:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294219&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-24T15:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294220&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-24T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78877"},{"time":"2025-04-24T18:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294153&lang=en"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-25T09:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294653&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-25T12:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294406&lang=en"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 26 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-26T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294545&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-26T12:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294408&lang=en"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 27 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-27T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294548&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-27T12:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294409&lang=en"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"MON 28 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-28T12:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294410&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-28T13:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79130"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 29 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-29T12:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294588&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-29T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79145"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 30 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-30T12:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294412&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-30T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79181"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 01 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-01T11:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79254"},{"time":"2025-05-01T12:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294562&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-01T13:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79251"}]}],"length_in_minutes":95},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"The original Queens are back and hitting the big screen.

seems to have it pretty good in 2084 A.D. A heavily muscled construction worker, he boasts a beautiful wife, Lori, good friends, and a technologically advanced home featuring video phones and even video walls. But he is haunted by dreams of a mysterious brunette woman and the red wastelands of Mars. Quaid visits Rekall, a unique travel agency that implants the memory of an adventure into its customers' minds, to get the chance to live out his Martian fantasies. When something goes terribly wrong and a blocked off portion of his mind is activated, Quaid finds himself at the center of a dangerous conspiracy. He must travel to Mars and get to the bottom of why he is being hunted by henchmen. But how can he know that what he's experiencing isn't just part of the Rekall experience? Are the mutant revolutionaries on Mars his allies, enemies, or complete fabrications? And is the lovely brunette at his side nothing more than a figment of his imagination?","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/TOTALRECALL.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=arA4k8WJe1kuaUiWMIFJKLi1kwVF0iylrRWHC4lx0loIgwDMg%2BJAPMML6rNedd01xAln9cvrrCyhNuSia8xE6zM7BP4l%2Bwxk1r8ek7%2BdHnCoDWlwtTOhFQfsnL03C1YRd2eoC1Ew3DCids2Ab12pOlsnIdeCOp7N%2FRXx7AhDO8iBz62yWIYSP4Q8OmZBkjyUHOx9oHE7kQcgA6giIWZXR4fesMA8TCjxp4RwH%2BrZC3AQm5MC7sLZDg1k54Vpp3uI7NSO7ustNSGoOsxYE2jtfG3Z80QJj3%2FdJEnCiBueCzV%2FRwMDccsDP3fgtCB8%2FQqSRW844J%2BUBgTxE59yTW6s8g%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase

The film delves into the experiences of those who travel solely by harnessing the natural elements alone, following a diverse array of traditional boats and uncovering the unique rhythms and motivations of engineless navigation.\n\nJourneying through rivers, coastlines, and open seas, spanning the UK, the Netherlands, and France, Wind, Tide & Oar creates a contemplative space, addressing themes of ecology, heritage, traditional skills, and maritime history. Using a 1960s hand-wound camera, Wahl offers a poetic and intimate perspective on a millennia-old craft, upended by the invention of mechanised power.\n\nThrough the film’s reveries, sailing becomes a means to explore our interaction with and responsibility to the environment. It invites deep reflection on our relationship with nature, our understanding of and commitment to sustainability, and our care for the world around us.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/WIND%2CTIDE%26OAR.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KI%2BduxQzYkqQbjfc5sD7kpUDFV1Eni%2By3ckzIiGN5ZWqrCf1iT9rcEXWt9OV7jDPwLKYLBuo9kMlsro21PH2j0EZa%2BnImVVN6SXkaf6eRWpLes5k%2FFhxJUICspJnxIfyhVd4nkL2P0EGC5NRUBlVScytNICduLoLe1Y4Gp5aai6elwfQgCag%2BThgtdaOjzdb%2BHZzebTvBYkuEl7AMehPQXz62R7N%2Fif90YdfSmZhUkFrlSpLjn1m6ieHTCb5yrv%2BA0MOu8Y02UbeM3jpwOk2rU1rew3X4RJjSSLmoKSPrnHkdVqSimiuf%2B7lUhsW3BzqTcTyJoW9CgzPE7A%2BG7onGw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground.

Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-24T10:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294218&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-24T11:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78890"},{"time":"2025-04-24T12:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294219&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-24T15:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294220&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-24T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78877"},{"time":"2025-04-24T18:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294153&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"SIX The Musical – Live! on the Big Screen at Showcase Cinemas!\n\nWest End sensation Six The Musical is making its way to the big screen, offering audiences a dazzling cinematic experience of the Tony Award-winning production.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-25T08:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79083"},{"time":"2025-04-25T08:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40787"}]}]},{"title":"GOLDBEAK","description":"Kitty Jinbao, who lost his parents, left the chicken village and was raised by a kind-hearted mother chicken.

The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 27 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-27T08:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40829"}]}]},{"title":"GOLDBEAK","description":"Kitty Jinbao, who lost his parents, left the chicken village and was raised by a kind-hearted mother chicken.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 28 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-28T08:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40851"}]}]},{"title":"GOLDBEAK","description":"Kitty Jinbao, who lost his parents, left the chicken village and was raised by a kind-hearted mother chicken.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 28 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-28T12:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294410&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-28T13:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79130"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"SIX The Musical – Live! on the Big Screen at Showcase Cinemas!\n\nWest End sensation Six The Musical is making its way to the big screen, offering audiences a dazzling cinematic experience of the Tony Award-winning production.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 29 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-29T12:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79176"}]}]},{"title":"GOLDBEAK","description":"Kitty Jinbao, who lost his parents, left the chicken village and was raised by a kind-hearted mother chicken.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 30 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-30T08:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40917"}]}]},{"title":"GOLDBEAK","description":"Kitty Jinbao, who lost his parents, left the chicken village and was raised by a kind-hearted mother chicken.

Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 30 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-30T12:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294412&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-30T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79181"}]}]},{"title":"STAR WARS: EPISODE III - REVENGE OF THE SITH","description":"Three years into the Clone Wars, the Jedi rescue Palpatine from Count Dooku.

exploration of engineless sailing, shot on analogue film over three years. The film delves into the experiences of those who travel solely by harnessing the natural elements alone, following a diverse array of traditional boats and uncovering the unique rhythms and motivations of engineless navigation.\n\nJourneying through rivers, coastlines, and open seas, spanning the UK, the Netherlands, and France, Wind, Tide & Oar creates a contemplative space, addressing themes of ecology, heritage, traditional skills, and maritime history. Using a 1960s hand-wound camera, Wahl offers a poetic and intimate perspective on a millennia-old craft, upended by the invention of mechanised power.\n\nThrough the film’s reveries, sailing becomes a means to explore our interaction with and responsibility to the environment. It invites deep reflection on our relationship with nature, our understanding of and commitment to sustainability, and our care for the world around us.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/WIND%2CTIDE%26OAR.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KI%2BduxQzYkqQbjfc5sD7kpUDFV1Eni%2By3ckzIiGN5ZWqrCf1iT9rcEXWt9OV7jDPwLKYLBuo9kMlsro21PH2j0EZa%2BnImVVN6SXkaf6eRWpLes5k%2FFhxJUICspJnxIfyhVd4nkL2P0EGC5NRUBlVScytNICduLoLe1Y4Gp5aai6elwfQgCag%2BThgtdaOjzdb%2BHZzebTvBYkuEl7AMehPQXz62R7N%2Fif90YdfSmZhUkFrlSpLjn1m6ieHTCb5yrv%2BA0MOu8Y02UbeM3jpwOk2rU1rew3X4RJjSSLmoKSPrnHkdVqSimiuf%2B7lUhsW3BzqTcTyJoW9CgzPE7A%2BG7onGw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":84,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 01 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-01T11:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79255"}]}]},{"title":"GOLDBEAK","description":"Kitty Jinbao, who lost his parents, left the chicken village and was raised by a kind-hearted mother chicken.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 01 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-01T11:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79254"},{"time":"2025-05-01T12:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294562&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-01T13:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79251"}]}]},{"title":"SYLVANIAN FAMILIES: THE MOVIE","description":"The annual Star Festival arrives in Sylvanian Village again this year.

Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton-Jones.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BJ%C3%96RK%3ACORNUCOPIA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=uk23f%2FKtU2kDFftu9tL01hL1J%2BBDmugvxZ2w2MOj%2FETtyCqnZzKEUbEFQEMRTFxdamo%2BC8hr8qjgGa39f%2BK%2BfgAQUWa9gYWT%2BBtV25%2BvtjkgJaJny62SEk%2BIgOX4aO0yLOZyhiZJZ3gR8x1WJQ7o0mPkNeFFlX8Nd%2Bars4juDUmDPf9bKBR%2FRg9BFJP7IaFXlHWok3nA06L8VtWxUdXjcGVwFKuOafBnqHnd3kkTA6t%2BRXQwpVMgNZ0GyaIzrJO1SkdstaoCNradjlJZeuWSow418mbMEocQC0Rupxci%2BQ8k4TCImNYEiIMaHOMAYSxx3gIE%2B%2BgirJS%2BDFWDxNg85w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":120,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 07 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-07T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40397"},{"time":"2025-05-07T18:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40201"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET’S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"Bluey at the Cinema: Let’s Play Chef Collection is an hour-long treat for fans of Bluey to enjoy, made up of eight episodes from the TV show’s three series, all based around the fun of food!

decline and recovery as a backdrop, \"Desire: The Carl Craig Story\" follows the career of a musical pioneer whose genre-defying techno music – which was inspired by a wide range of sounds, has been performed to jazz enthusiasts at the Montreux Jazz Festival and in the premier classical auditoriums around the world, including Carnegie Hall.\n\nThirty-five years into his music career, Carl Craig, a leading figure of the second generation of the Detroit techno artists, has now been embraced by the visual arts world, with recent exhibitions at MOCA in Los Angeles and Dia Beacon in New

Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37639"}]}]},{"title":"HURRY UP TOMORROW","description":"A musician struggling with the strain of touring connects with an enigmatic fan in this US drama.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HURRYUPTOMORROW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=UwtODgApXL9uf%2Fqk5jMSWOGQhiahZFXSKJJ7oPTnPnvN4TETSQtEodQGN7j%2FrpvYeQ6KDsFBLaYr8M0EBT3mNbHktSzrakKB1fYQKhg42QDHTnjo7PmYRCjAT93jB1A%2B6d7fNkW%2FmfX1r1kadKlRSBrLL9rQRxWVeSOkSTTUkd%2F4oXavGhKsp%2FqdQl%2BpmlGwo9sEUQeLlcYoD5oHyClpKpdx%2FStWpBhk97zFp%2B8DMSkcXrPBZQuELi2Jd%2FJXITSUrNYFhxgl3owrwxvd19A44fIgVAhwWcjlHA2FMcklvozxtF82LgnlvQfb1%2FXt%2FHH7q0H1KtzRZQHAy9rmCXHjcw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":105,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-22T15:40:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151846"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-22T18:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151847"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-22T20:50:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151845"}]}]},{"title":"RBO: BALLET TO BROADWAY: WHEELDON WORKS","description":"Sensuous contemporary ballet meets the energy of musical theatre in four distinctive short works.
