In January 2020, with the shoot almost complete, rumours regarding an illness begin to circulate. A hairdresser from Wuhan is sent home, while the crew follows the news on their phones. The director has to decide whether to halt the filming once again. Some of the crew and actors manage to leave before the hotel is locked down by security guards and everyone left on set is confined to their hotel rooms. As all communication is reduced to phone screens, Wuhan is locked down. The crew continues to communicate via video calls, whilst the quarantined main actor Jiang Cheng struggles to support his wife who is now locked-down with their month-old baby in Beijing.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ANUNFINISHEDFILM.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=uDTI7ah2Hj08WTfJJI8E1QxHfsuiq5Z%2BIoXiw%2BCBZ9EmRaUMf7CROqnDpi6K1Xrp4861Xqm%2FpoPOE0PpUyzmyIfxILm5Vp7lBxLf%2B3DFIPrV8ho1bPa%2BEoTsW7jaOGm0Yl0MpzcRfDod9lqYkspASSfkRhQQR82XruFSHqvYcSWHWZiRL%2BNPzSQa1cOST1rmFcJUskC6dekOf7rtJLOReIl%2FFjqXw7Oq879fbsVA5hgeAkSr61Elx7GTjqWzsNkH4MtwrSS7KGSW0S0rIMqdPCslyw%2FnEdrrt0oqsgUa9rPFLh4v35DWuOmJXbct7Xfgf16mpbs6r0aCh01G4%2FiIQQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-16T16:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80487"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 17 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-17T16:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80399"}]}],"length_in_minutes":107},{"title":"ANDRE RIEU'S 2025 MAASTRICHT CONCERT: WALTZ THE NIGHT AWAY!","description":"Step into a night of music, romance, and celebration with André Rieu’s Waltz the Night Away!

biblical proportions washes its home away, a solitary cat must seek refuge with a motley crew of animals, who gradually learn to get along in this endearing, Oscar-winning animation.\n\nWunderkind director Gints Zilbalodis has taken the animation world by storm with his beautifully crafted sophomore feature Flow, which has received a multitude of awards and nominations to date, including two nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards.  \n\nThe mystical world he creates in Flow is in peril. There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.

for the very first time on Sunday May 18 at Cineworld’s 4DX Family Day and grab a 4DX Ticket for just £4/€4 per person. Three thousand years ago, the greatest sailors in the world voyaged across the vast South Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, for a millennium, their voyages stopped – and no one today knows why. From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes “Moana,” a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who sails out on a daring mission to save her people. During her journey, Moana (voice of Auliʻi Cravalho) meets the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson), who guides her in her quest to become a master wayfinder. Together, they sail across the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills the ancient quest of her ancestors and discovers the one thing she’s always sought: her own identity.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/MOANA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=Q4jlQd7pgowM5Ryj5mE6nAsNLO6lZMEwGAT2vVh5impsHAs16j5O1luPET%2BCKiVqhvf31nb7QNaXV0PMtO5XT3FHO4miBKE24XMHI4ckwis1W6upPsOtMOJntjoY81GlS5CfWQ8P1awAoI5%2BACpwwn6Athy%2BUJIusmhdffyCWnt2qZdWIRmy%2B4C05afLIDKgW60BZ7fkyxmSKEQE%2BI14VjwdJkLuRKij0lZAB323DhzNwg5A%2Bh6fstUqGlzLzfS3Y2AZyT72p0xZS3TEEPY%2BQfv6eG40h7DAGVvxURz2vTZcJ9wRde%2FnTCdQthhmE9lDqczZKONM54nXbPh8VRFshQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 17 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-17T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295751&lang=en"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 18 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-18T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295195&lang=en"}]}],"length_in_minutes":108},{"title":"MR.

MCMLXXII","description":"Pink Floyd at Pompeii – MCMLXXII, the groundbreaking 1972 film directed by Adrian Maben, returns to theaters, now digitally re-mastered in 4K from the original 35mm footage with enhanced audio. \nSet in the hauntingly beautiful ruins of the ancient Roman Amphitheater in Pompeii, Italy, the film captures Pink Floyd performing an intimate concert without an audience. Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release. Inspired by the golden warmth of Pompeii’s iconic setting, the remaster transforms this timeless piece into a masterpiece of sight and sound. Experience Pink Floyd like never before through this pioneering audio-visual remaster!","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/PINKFLOYDATPOMPEIIMCMLXXII.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=XSK%2B9YtKPUsTykcdFQsdRxAvKm%2FLyhfskrcTGaaafsOpCdWclfJsmNaCET%2B2MKZk%2FSTvkN1GZtpvVQsSeSx4SDmKccsSvMxJ4DyniK8HTDZrtZnYAHsstzC1sZOjKeNA2Z2yEQ8PvWUz%2B8No63qwLHOVTa%2BYt0ZmUbuVmdOOceQcWslsuq10o0f4xXdah0GXTEAtFgfS0d64Aho1aaD8jWWwWmvGttYTmX3hRrivwNCXsSoi47rMf5AlJEP7SRn3rsH7b9S0DJ04Hy4hW2nKu10KITVI2w1m7dgPsZ8UHGVedvbwPpndhz3ItlE99xb2yVzEUQeXNHpv%2Fqylmy1x%2Bg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-15T13:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80119"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"MON 19 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-19T15:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80546"}]}],"length_in_minutes":85},{"title":"PIP AND POSY: SANDPIT FRIENDS","description":"Pip and Posy are best friends whose lives revolve around a wonderful world of play.

As they navigate their entangled past, they must forge a new identity—one that comes at a cost paid in emotions, blood, and life.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SHAUNKISARDAR.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=tKtA0epU5nOtBAmr9IXYwzXw8wxLZCx8z%2F5GcdLm1MdATbKRROgmjS1cFqbbwL1wqRZ1A2Q6fJFC9luNaLS4yK7XbXQi1zKsd4XngAmdrJhhJk5gtazYFNKXp1sMrsemmNtxwObFq9%2Fc9th7W%2BNRH9bLIYSeKA1q2GSpQlAc57c0pemtJt4IV%2FlLe67W9Y9Ysg5SGW8QhqONfGr1sEhyCu9Ohh%2Bv0%2BgpjXG1NGmV4%2FfZjB8Rvhts7OJJAXV%2BLu4BSSWeNCZvH8aR4nq0zxQLTYMiX3ClkmiXV%2BG%2BHTpNJ52hccCn4S3%2FqIa%2FJkCSdbaE4%2F9lC43pRCOavEj0xSgpvg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-16T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80497"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 17 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-17T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80398"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 18 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-18T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80463"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"MON 19 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80642"}]}],"length_in_minutes":141},{"title":"SHREK","description":"Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there lived an ornery ogre named Shrek whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying fairy tale characters. There are blind mice in his food, a big, bad wolf in his bed, three little homeless pigs and more, all banished from their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad.\n\nDetermined to save their home--not to mention his own--Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona to be Farquaad's bride. Accompanying him on his mission is wisecracking Donkey, who will do anything for Shrek... except shut up. Rescuing the Princess from a fire-breathing dragon may prove the least of their problems when the deep, dark secret she has been keeping is revealed.\n\nThis film is showing as part of Toddler Club - the perfect place to introduce your future film lover (aged 1-5) to the magic of the movies!

Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-16T13:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80479"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 17 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-17T13:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80403"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 18 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-18T13:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80436"}]}],"length_in_minutes":91},{"title":"THE ACCOUNTANT 2","description":"Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) has a talent for solving complex problems.

Andrew Ahn comes a joyful comedy of errors about a chosen family navigating the disasters and delights of family expectations, queerness, and cultural identity. Angela and her partner Lee have been unlucky with their IVF treatments, but can’t afford to pay for another round. Meanwhile, their friend Min, the closeted scion of a multinational corporate empire, has plenty of family money but a soon-to-expire student visa. When his commitment-phobic boyfriend Chris rejects his proposal, Min makes the offer to Angela instead: a green card marriage in exchange for funding Lee’s IVF. But their plans to quietly elope are upended when Min’s sceptical grandmother flies in from Korea unannounced, insisting on an all-out wedding extravaganza. With a pitch-perfect cast of multigenerational talent that includes Bowen Yang, Academy Award nominee Lily Gladstone, Kelly Marie Tran, Han Gi-chan, Joan Chen, and Academy Award winner Youn Yuh-jung, this fresh reimagining of Ang Lee’s beloved, Award-winning rom-com teems with humour and heart in a poignant reminder that being part of a family means learning to both accept and forgive.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEWEDDINGBANQUET.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=He5dE8kXzNnhwgM%2B4xEC%2Fqd45pC2nq9SG2eE%2FQm7VDLJ4YPbFRATF7c%2B%2FLdushtCCwJjzWcJH0MBUwgAzaz5UmQUTnY%2BTAVMYlMhUFezejeS%2FAr58KgRC9S541uWK56VHVrqGGF1evmpaLo6XkaEfdKmMDVK0TBGkInACivmWueihCxOOE3b0xGSKPwMW2fBZIXCmZlAaFN8iPamwlrhZ9qgOQXTWEUmP3OoK6TidkmsNN4Tto%2FKq0l8qHNYjRBZRXxjYwK3uHHWLu4jM417TyfzFdGb4P8rH6d5%2FuepK8uzHIk4l9QQFC5AJ8xGp8XuC%2B1AdEXPiufqWHfhNLe7lw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-15T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295648&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-15T14:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80059"},{"time":"2025-05-15T16:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295649&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-15T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80058"},{"time":"2025-05-15T19:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295650&lang=en"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 15 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-15T19:15:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020254/288776","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 17 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-17T19:15:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020254/288777","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 24 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-24T18:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020254/288778","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":103},{"title":"THOMAS & FRIENDS: JOURNEY BEYOND SODOR","description":"Let your little ones experience the magic of cinema with our mini-movies!\n\nThomas and his friends travel to the mainland to save James and show that friendship is more important than being the favourite engine.

best-selling memoir by Raynor Winn.\n\nThe Salt Path is the profound true story of husband and wife, Raynor and Moth Winn’s 630-mile trek along the beautiful but rugged Cornish, Devon and Dorset coastline.\n\nAfter being forcibly removed from their home, they make the desperate decision to walk in the hope that, in nature, they will find solace and a sense of acceptance. With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination. The Salt Path is a journey that is exhilarating, challenging, and liberating in equal measure. A portrayal of home, how it can be lost and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.\n\nEach ticket includes a complimentary popcorn.","rating":"12A","image_link":null,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 29 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-29T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41308"}]}],"length_in_minutes":115},{"title":"UEFA EUROPA LEAGUE FINAL 2025","description":"","rating":"tbc","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/UEFAEUROPALEAGUEFINAL2025.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H490JGVfBREewz%2FysO0dwbTGXVsmoWtbAWyyjDoK30QiSO6C76nuSmsW94Fm4gDBBiozyclEwiyHOhFHEpllFLKjAVmx%2B7kVRwzF8Vd7b6zQyMzksg7ru8cfUUuOaDMKKE1ZWfvdqRvLLs15H3VEw2hUr1jDosYD10stJn%2FZSpoSBG9pY1pQfkIq%2F2kyVMfMonWHdEm7SRVI7Mo0V4Wnd6iUZYWicA%2BhYEfpR2vsbYHDeWDRRXz1LUbvDp4mRRPti%2Bj5LGXGAjHJ5NyG5JZWLEkVyVnJW4EMSrQisHhmjMz4DCr4G3iRsey2%2FBfUMCZ0sFcnTf1nKj4%2FcafQEihpEQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 21 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-21T18:45:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020401/288667","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":0},{"title":"UNTIL DAWN","description":"One year after her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers.

In January 2020, with the shoot almost complete, rumours regarding an illness begin to circulate. A hairdresser from Wuhan is sent home, while the crew follows the news on their phones. The director has to decide whether to halt the filming once again. Some of the crew and actors manage to leave before the hotel is locked down by security guards and everyone left on set is confined to their hotel rooms. As all communication is reduced to phone screens, Wuhan is locked down.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-16T13:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80479"}]}]},{"title":"THE ACCOUNTANT 2","description":"Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) has a talent for solving complex problems.

In January 2020, with the shoot almost complete, rumours regarding an illness begin to circulate. A hairdresser from Wuhan is sent home, while the crew follows the news on their phones. The director has to decide whether to halt the filming once again.

During her journey, Moana (voice of Auliʻi Cravalho) meets the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson), who guides her in her quest to become a master wayfinder.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 17 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-17T13:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80403"}]}]},{"title":"THE ACCOUNTANT 2","description":"Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) has a talent for solving complex problems.

 features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 18 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-18T13:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80436"}]}]},{"title":"THE ACCOUNTANT 2","description":"Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) has a talent for solving complex problems.

Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release. Inspired by the golden warmth of Pompeii’s iconic setting, the remaster transforms this timeless piece into a masterpiece of sight and sound.

Ignoring the warnings of the terrified researcher who maintains that the chimps are infected, they begin to free the animals and are immediately subjected to a bloody attack from the enraged creatures. Twenty-eight days later, Cycle courier Jim awakes from a coma in the deserted intensive care unit of a London hospital. He wanders out into a church where he finds dead bodies piled in heaps on the chapel floor. A sudden explosion from a makeshift bomb heralds the arrival of fellow \"survivors\" Selina and Mark. They take Jim to safety and explain to him that this infection is transmitted by blood and overwhelms the infected victim with a murderous rage within seconds. Britain has been overrun, and they have no way of knowing if it has spread worldwide. Their only hope of survival may lie in the hands of a Manchester group of soldiers, as they claim to have the \"answer\" to infection and invite any survivors to join them at their blockade. Faced with no practical alternative, the group sets out northwards, unaware that the worst is yet to come.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/28DAYSLATER.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=FYLYVVeVNjHrNLeIJ5zH5sndYpnmOahbk74Uk829ukaTkGyXDU5YN2sdDoKNVt9gTOToY7467OEwfMCcqUHM0hXNlkY9JusEq8XijLufCdbFVD1%2Btmjs%2BJPso%2FUnoBCVsrAtZnJckiQU%2BpTOp245sOrcevSfMcetAPW9NDOzzB%2Bs4RyVhleqCswYVBd5TRR0OYqoukpD%2BFNbneOr9JA%2FpVZOPfymHCpsvMnRQrVNwsJixcJXN%2F26gd%2FXNdG14Zt1m62DpbbX51AYSLT4h0D2AWBUzqEDeHMvpYzJf%2B%2BEsmVLIVvcrYfRPqaaFjByXvVvF%2FO6jktUCRTzSkeML82d0A%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":120,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/EXHIBITIONONSCREENMICHELANGELOLOVEANDDEATH.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=RIKC4YjofCvL%2BTPjAl5V1DrWDT%2FujgKz2KlsvRhMkklwprbq4Kc9K0DhxFUn1B5fs9ZHr4ZLG2x0iqn%2Fv2W4yV4FuGf2%2BFIC6kREd%2FjIdum1FKxadwVX10VUdtUelZYxh1jfgmZBoYOmedNlMJQq197mYBQvIvWvy8J40T4CRoGsyNvo4hn%2FGWtSCfuDC7htD8A1w5Qgm0tNGqpj%2BUUC%2B5Txi42joHjLY%2FMz6WHUABBMtKM1jPxI%2FLKKtNq7hvJ7jt3lC7wDCq7l8NiGPDLeNmrvpv4ZZ55Wn4LlmWf5XBsGDJ8QPYzMASCfaDfeMSyn9aHxDhNNu%2F8PqmPxJDViMA%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all

With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination. The Salt Path is a journey that is exhilarating, challenging, and liberating in equal measure. A portrayal of home, how it can be lost and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.\n\nEach ticket includes a complimentary popcorn.","rating":"12A","image_link":null,"length_in_minutes":115,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 29 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-29T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41308"}]}]}]},{"tab_date_label":"FRI 30 MAY","film_data":[{"title":"KARATE KID: LEGENDS","description":"Daniel arrives in Beijing, where Mr. Han has been seeking him out.

violent images. Ignoring the warnings of the terrified researcher who maintains that the chimps are infected, they begin to free the animals and are immediately subjected to a bloody attack from the enraged creatures. Twenty-eight days later, Cycle courier Jim awakes from a coma in the deserted intensive care unit of a London hospital. He wanders out into a church where he finds dead bodies piled in heaps on the chapel floor. A sudden explosion from a makeshift bomb heralds the arrival of fellow \"survivors\" Selina and Mark. They take Jim to safety and explain to him that this infection is transmitted by blood and overwhelms the infected victim with a murderous rage within seconds. Britain has been overrun, and they have no way of knowing if it has spread worldwide. Their only hope of survival may lie in the hands of a Manchester group of soldiers, as they claim to have the \"answer\" to infection and invite any survivors to join them at their blockade. Faced with no practical alternative, the group sets out northwards, unaware that the worst is yet to come.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/28DAYSLATER.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=FYLYVVeVNjHrNLeIJ5zH5sndYpnmOahbk74Uk829ukaTkGyXDU5YN2sdDoKNVt9gTOToY7467OEwfMCcqUHM0hXNlkY9JusEq8XijLufCdbFVD1%2Btmjs%2BJPso%2FUnoBCVsrAtZnJckiQU%2BpTOp245sOrcevSfMcetAPW9NDOzzB%2Bs4RyVhleqCswYVBd5TRR0OYqoukpD%2BFNbneOr9JA%2FpVZOPfymHCpsvMnRQrVNwsJixcJXN%2F26gd%2FXNdG14Zt1m62DpbbX51AYSLT4h0D2AWBUzqEDeHMvpYzJf%2B%2BEsmVLIVvcrYfRPqaaFjByXvVvF%2FO6jktUCRTzSkeML82d0A%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":120,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 13 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-13T19:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295867&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"PEPPA MEETS THE BABY CINEMA EXPERIENCE","description":"PIG changes are coming!
