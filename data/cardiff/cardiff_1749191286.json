One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as

MOVIE","description":"Dubbed “the greatest that never was,” Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) was FORMULA 1’s most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career.  Thirty years later, he’s a nomadic racer-for-hire when he’s approached by his former teammate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), owner of a struggling FORMULA 1 team that is on the verge of collapse.  Ruben convinces Sonny to come back to FORMULA 1 for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world.  He’ll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace.  But as the engines roar, Sonny’s past catches up with him and he finds that in FORMULA 1, your teammate is your fiercest competition—and the road to redemption is not something you can travel alone.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/F1THEMOVIE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=Puo%2BfrCkLKu%2B%2Fy2cm2fAhpSMgy725%2BY%2FT1DLH2OrAW7klnoJyVGaV%2BPGlaeBTXDcyiGGCSTZBMXWELaUJPMxmZPdux%2FPDAtY20KE%2FzxjesFASiKW16ftZHpdeKadHjHu0CFe%2BKJhLAGOp7L4JR7T%2BXWcSWdfzUKaDH%2FlMYzu0nrXXCrQxlPUbP9%2FRwJ%2BYjczVpUqRRA5hQ%2Buujgf4JnooAIQn8vPSg2iwyn4PBWgXJv3tHX2%2B67%2FKbi8HmaGRkLNY8BpJjrKYnYNYOapZ%2BQcNpEqe9d%2Fe1W2gx2eylQi80%2BFSk2zbgGf9zMOW3vnJEJ0JkuRbRHrlf92Q2WQGk19%2FQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED

determined to break barriers and obtain his amateur boxing license—the crucial first step toward his dream of becoming a professional fighter. But the real fight isn’t just in the ring; it’s against a system that continues to put up obstacles, reflecting the everyday struggles disabled people face simply to be included in society.\n\nFeaturing leading disability advocates such as Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson and 'Fury the Gladiator' (Jodie Ounsley), Fighters not only tells Matt’s story but educates and challenges a non-disabled audience to confront the deep-rooted inequalities disabled people still battle today.\nDespite living in an era of progress, disabled people are still fighting for inclusion—whether in sports, broadcasting, the arts, government, media, or business. While many have made a powerful impact, others continue to face unnecessary barriers to equality.\n\nFighters is more than just a film—it’s a wake-up call. A powerful, real-life portrayal of one man’s relentless pursuit of acceptance and an inspiring testament to the strength of the human spirit.\n\nThis is a film that needs to be seen—not just by the disabled community, but by everyone—because if you want something bad enough, you might just have to fight for it. A recorded Q&A will play after the film.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FIGHTERSQA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=RP9VXlRO2rCeBailxI0wyIVD4Jpcat4wpaSRx4mGqkeTQtLIbgseB0kDs8L1t%2FcEk336ahR%2BwQ09U7ce3OxjXBxYFwMVpBTS9Q1RFQRGX6OlsMRA62%2FDqW5GN5bfS%2Fwq50J%2F6%2BTVdntlqLF1oCVhXIKWgOk9raiyMeBKOsIdQ4FgPChWfhCr%2F%2F%2Bw8OqovyWWET4YXb%2BON7lYUoj0ZispXXrHav26y%2FvQvjMDX1aOaovZ6DWPCNdii5yi9FBvS6PdrC5PjfBXG8aNCEJj96DDS8RUh17Hx5QHyieTHRfiEf8s53raK7MyBrekCqyIAoxDgYmTGkTphu6gNu%2FYuV%2Fs3g%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 23 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-23T18:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-81760"}]}],"length_in_minutes":75},{"title":"FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES","description":"The newest chapter in New Line Cinema’s bloody successful franchise takes audiences back to the very beginning of Death’s twisted sense of justice.

Not only has he had to put up with his overbearing Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon Dursley and their dread of his magical abilities, but also it seems as if Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger have forgotten him, as they haven't replied to a single one of his letters. Then, suddenly and mysteriously, house-elf Dobby appears in Harry's bedroom and warns him of great danger if he should attempt to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But despite the elf's mischievous efforts to thwart Harry's return to school, the ever-determined Harry is rescued from the Dursley's dreary clutches by Ron and his brothers and whisked into the warmth of the Weasley household. Upon arriving at Hogwarts, Harry finds that his first year heroics have caused him to become the center of much unwanted attention. His new fans include Ron's little sister Ginny; first year would-be photographer Colin Creevey; and most irritatingly, the New Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Gilderoy Lockhart. Outshone only by his own vanity, Lockhart craves the attention that Harry shuns. But not even Lockhart can offer an explanation for the sinister new terror that is gripping the school.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HARRYPOTTERANDTHECHAMBEROFSECRETS.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=us1ARgaCgnNPDZ%2BUzd8Lu46vXksgwAckaY3rFu1nc1JDmgyY%2FXfhBKIQlkRhnwCKlpLWI87pN7Ug2TqiHWY5dCGBrTRbVPSdXaZOZAc67%2BQViS7e8v5V7wTe2JmgPktwbqnZjP50ktLl%2BfR1blaatayAg5i7hkZotCcCSkRroyfrH476RIfbUcEBHniNEEs573LgfqYbAC1oIRP%2F2wbmkLdXq9iZHS5Ehi%2FiGIyQ3EXZzTOPvmKqg4FHyYpvZaP17o5orBrdiVH3KbK0BdCoQ2G%2F80VDOAEapDYX98JbZmEpjnTtbXRS9ShuDU54TdThghITv36d8KRDFvJquC9S8w%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 05 JUL","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-07-05T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154711"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 06 JUL","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-07-06T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154712"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 12 JUL","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-07-12T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154713"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 13 JUL","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-07-13T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154714"}]}],"length_in_minutes":158},{"title":"HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE","description":"A young wizard finds himself competing in a hazardous tournament between rival schools of magic, but he is distracted by recurring nightmares.","rating":"12a","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HARRYPOTTERANDTHEGOBLETOFFIRE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=LGCaYBoQqKFX%2FEeJLxGFdWu58PRJa%2Fz0MWSIQciAAhMu7XI6il8UypikZ6mK%2FVzQq%2BTLF3fBt%2B4yIrvbhojkmP7qsj6nN7l5VriZccriF3axYDIr5w7knhA%2F9S%2Fd%2FkHmcsN7TZtJdqnHBsPqB2Z%2BCztRmrdSoQsHoilPb5GsSx3oIAyn%2FhyNdZ4fAcKHdr%2F5LrhFHYBS4%2B8qrMtpmCnb6VhNck4ZkAOK47VpU7cE%2FaqgLfyflNfEWMYZL9Kvc%2F4KNuSUJ4wAcI0Jhx98CGuM0ID2QWmtdJzpv1B4Kv%2Bkrpeaog%2BqMQYSMGarZ2sSpjTBz1lwWOLC5bpH4TRv5YIO%2BA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 30 AUG","screenings":[{"time":"2025-08-30T14:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020382/288824","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"MON 01 SEPT","screenings":[{"time":"2025-09-01T18:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020382/288826","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":0},{"title":"HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE","description":"Harry Potter has learned to live with his bullying Uncle Vernon, his callous Aunt Petunia and the constant whining of his greedy, spoiled cousin Dudley.

Harry's relatives have just as reluctantly learned to live with the unwelcome presence of their orphaned relation, a constant reminder of Petunia's \"wayward\" sister and brother-in-law and their mysterious and untimely demise. Even the impending arrival of his 11th birthday offers no excitement for Harry- as usual, there's little chance of cards, presents or any kind of birthday treat. This year, however, is different. On his 11th birthday, Harry learns that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. Invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime. At Hogwarts, he finds the home and family he has never had.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HARRYPOTTERANDTHEPHILOSOPHERSSTONE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=m9ZHSQPgSpyoMQkzUHQJL%2Fh406KtIaE9ew0zZO1VedlUfM1i%2BN6o3rJrYyZFhl7C1R6maAvt7mxsrR62nSjQrBF%2FN1IJToDw6F3W5ucejmO0sZLweiURSA73DLkzHrQYXWWUYHFMl9v33jZzV8k8HwJnhS6zRkK%2FkZfzq7hhuO2QFL9y3dDilWt0nb3EdNamsGx1QPX6EZisN0EpDSqSqUoQBe0lZokHLs0nKcJlDA%2FgpPOnK8fXEHomcDpGXRbu8GJEEawVVYXN%2FwHPc8HK2N48Ekl1XiljiEtYvlSKtTAI15ADyCq6GjkWuhEtn0C57yiVsF7z62W02B0jjKZwqg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-06-07T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154423"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 08 JUN","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-06-08T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154424"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 14 JUN","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-06-14T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154704"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 15 JUN","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-06-15T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154705"}]}],"length_in_minutes":152},{"title":"HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN","description":"Thirteen year-old Harry Potter has reluctantly spent yet another summer with the Dursleys, his dismal relatives, \"behaving himself\" and not practicing any magic. That is, until Uncle Vernon's bullying sister, Aunt Marge, comes to visit. Aunt Marge has always been particularly horrible to Harry and this time pushes him so far that he \"accidentally\" causes her to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift away! Fearing punishment from his Aunt and Uncle--and repercussions from Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, which strictly forbids students from using magic in the non-magic world--Harry escapes into the night. Along the way, Harry will try to make sense of Hermione's puzzling appearances and disappearances, with the help of Ron and the giant Hagrid, who has taken on a new position at Hogwarts as the Care of Magical Creatures teacher. A confrontation between Harry and the menacing Sirius Black seems inevitable, but what exactly is Professor Lupin's relationship with Black? What is the dark secret that Professor Snape is so eager to reveal? And just why is Ron's pet rat Scabbers so frantic to escape his grasp? Harry will need all of the courage, magic and support he can muster to answer these questions and uncover the truth behind Sirius Black and his ties to the gifted young wizard's mysterious past.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HARRYPOTTERANDTHEPRISONEROFAZKABAN.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=As14dtrQkMeIaC1ko3r03VHN2jvXF70jxnqoeor2JwUcjgRcQ0iz1sJ%2Bx4O1OjrzyUpO3IHl3tcAMewuKamZ5kWsugPTSV8II5CKHdPjdJSVh4L05%2FDlDSuG85MJ%2BNQwr9QohF%2FXLek99gZ65b%2FLusXneU%2Bezhh7plxkHbCvrZaO8wZBPbQLriTJm6P3Pvp%2BW6VGKbtaoL59Dig7qKdwPX2vqcFX2ju4JgMAEfe6gfp%2Fb73laR9ib4U8hlXDyFGXpv4c8cKiApXZ9ucZtT2%2BZECYi8H5%2FJKw72cnuood4dBqBcLVk9gQyQ66MyWHQvbzv3%2B8sInUhFRaNkLg1ymnfw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 02 AUG","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-08-02T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154719"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 03 AUG","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-08-03T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154720"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 09 AUG","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-08-09T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154721"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 10 AUG","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-08-10T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154722"}]}],"length_in_minutes":141},{"title":"HOT MILK","description":"The directorial debut from award-winning screenwriter Rebecca Lenkiewicz (Ida, Disobedience), HOT MILK is an intimate exploration of self-discovery, desire, and the complex bonds that shape us, based on the acclaimed novel by Deborah Levy.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HOTMILK.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=p5IuxsHPCwskt0cIzNCjKEf%2BW5wTszwXIhOHErSyeMxBcRLB2qcx%2FdcAH00ftauzlATwoqLR%2FgTryyrcNQ6N0JuWGbWW1zGwSvgy2h7FEduA3pKbDGUcpTFEFq3n%2B9Yo2kUJb8HOlGJ%2BTWSze2pQTWuqsJos9H0VAmvTlhzYl5eiGmBBP35EhRmD5qdPXtqCL7Ndf9Pm8rPkdf1lswZJJ4oFrfKpIkmoSYz%2FUQ2ciBrUoWPW7Gf%2FPZvajtkOnSq7nxWhIeoSo4s6sTLMdKSbSvFyX4UrkcpqxtpSJ4KxIadrZ%2FM89R4JO0D%2FY1GhSl%2Fco6DtTr%2Fq9c7yaRNO21qIVQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 12 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-12T18:45:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020180/289643","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 15 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-15T17:15:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020180/289604","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 21 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-21T18:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020180/289369","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 29 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-29T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020180/289177","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":93},{"title":"HOUSEFULL 5 A","description":"Aboard one of the World’s most luxurious 20 storey cruise ship, birthday celebrations for the billionaire Mr. Dobriyal are interrupted by his demise, triggering a frenzy as three imposters claiming to be his long-lost heirs named “Jollys\" vie for his fortune.

On the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. With the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. As an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HOWTOTRAINYOURDRAGON.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=iU1Kyq1jvFhDGK%2BUtvM47e7Cn%2FUd%2F6mjYYme1heGy3eipgjIag%2FYYPyAUXi5Xkpmme36Dk%2BPa0UuZvX1AVm%2BsWF7y1%2FUDL8shTbjeLrkNh8lh%2BPVLXkvDEm7d5Of0arw5uYXCuEd0%2BKjaaxfkAenPVni0pwIGGRoCO5yMCXbwAW9HxGBFzMIESV1houz0js10nvEtC6iPdeTvyQN%2Fv9Lr8SyXx8pyD1JvGmFEA2it7OkIjkQ3wIIbOVRr2Dn5p9CgE1L8OhpUKKR4a6XpyI69WutY2xsTA3viA155GCm02ZDNUL7j1uaRu9E%2F5jsqU3I%2BhQZPxvPnmK4o5VKV4wirQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON

Tenor Xabier Anduaga returns after his acclaimed 2023 Met debut in L’Elisir d’Amore, co-starring as Amina’s fiancé Elvino, alongside soprano Sydney Mancasola as her rival, Lisa, and bass Alexander Vinogradov as Count Rodolfo.

The film humorously critiques Hollywood's beauty standards while celebrating the complexities of womanhood and explores the themes of motherhood, and self-discovery in Los Angeles.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEUNINVITED.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=N%2Br25RvGiPjPPC1%2BcCobTmlIzAGxkCmLfCDkemPQaUfs6whHSv01XX9Y5b9RRrT30g7V1gOxVdHgkGPmhrx7jRkZ%2Fj3KF%2FN7YMeVBV1OUJfDV%2FgK7plmjPoIrb%2Bu1z%2FsYlaZJ51O3zNfYooPxhEMtyPHbnwIMkViLLqs06k80IHm4JgHzrwQvzMHprzv6navaovGCrOeQnl4qJol0ZdtM6xGttsLxfNRREdNrmLln4wkS%2BGLxcJcobOVfYVvpr6brso8lhEMwo96s8YIkqPgGbAxnOvZAfirPSj9GK45EUY%2FFi6Q8hXBNPrNBIe%2Bb0PdVdiM0GXxZvk4gkuEr%2FhPMQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 10 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-10T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-81749"}]}],"length_in_minutes":98},{"title":"THE WEDDING BANQUET","description":"From Director Andrew Ahn comes a joyful comedy of errors about a chosen family navigating the disasters and delights of family expectations, queerness & cultural identity","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEWEDDINGBANQUET.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=He5dE8kXzNnhwgM%2B4xEC%2Fqd45pC2nq9SG2eE%2FQm7VDLJ4YPbFRATF7c%2B%2FLdushtCCwJjzWcJH0MBUwgAzaz5UmQUTnY%2BTAVMYlMhUFezejeS%2FAr58KgRC9S541uWK56VHVrqGGF1evmpaLo6XkaEfdKmMDVK0TBGkInACivmWueihCxOOE3b0xGSKPwMW2fBZIXCmZlAaFN8iPamwlrhZ9qgOQXTWEUmP3OoK6TidkmsNN4Tto%2FKq0l8qHNYjRBZRXxjYwK3uHHWLu4jM417TyfzFdGb4P8rH6d5%2FuepK8uzHIk4l9QQFC5AJ8xGp8XuC%2B1AdEXPiufqWHfhNLe7lw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 15 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-15T19:15:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020254/289635","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 17 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-17T19:15:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020254/289639","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 24 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-24T18:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020254/289368","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":103},{"title":"THEATRE LET","description":"","rating":"U","image_link":null,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 12 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-12T14:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=297074&lang=en"}]}],"length_in_minutes":100},{"title":"THOMAS & FRIENDS: JOURNEY BEYOND SODOR","description":"Let your little ones experience the magic of cinema with our mini-movies!\n\nThomas and his friends travel to the mainland to save James and show that friendship is more important than being the favourite engine.

about two friends and their adventure on a high-end food production reality TV show.\n\nEnthusiastic village girl Saulė (A. Ravdo) and modest single mother Ona (E. Ozarinskaitė) are passionate cooks trapped in the Kaunas canteen \"Tasty\". One day, without Ona's consent, Saulė involves them in a culinary reality show, the main prize of which is their own restaurant. Saulė lies to the jury about her origins and claims that they are both qualified chefs from the restaurant ‚La TASTY‘.\n\nAlthough the TASTY team is initially seen as a joke, their simple but brilliant recipes help them to become the viewers' favourites. Despite their success, tensions between the friends begin to rise as Ona receives more and more attention from the audience and from judge Emanuel (L. Pobedonoscevas). The celebrity chef of the competition, Bruknė (L. Rastokaitė), seizes the opportunity and tries to drive them further apart. Will the friendship between Ona and Saulė stand the test?","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/GARDUT%C4%96TASTY.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=xhbBkQDKSb4EtgmsilgEY7RYRA7tNqxHmeFnZNw%2FghGKlbwPguIB3rt7TwHu321ptZsmYXm4kz4Yen%2FF6wgbSI8o%2FxGOkw2XQYinFqmzj2eg20n4V6xpdT49cBp3G6b6zRBrCl%2F00A0qGP1WPsiUuiIDLQkF50uIROvErVN1aP4kjTcRyMI1rLr2Hc9CcHqp7gwAGy6Nw1WJGXDCgR3%2FHyhDC5eqyy%2FAW5kXVRTtLu4Mt571AcryCGElpgKTbFPyicf7VWxo%2BP6AFf3wc52p34lxWOPz9uXSoI3rgX3jEI6%2Ft50BYpRzIPypxSeW17xzdfkBjucLb3U5rOJ%2Bh8L08A%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":108,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-06-07T13:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/153565"}]}]},{"title":"HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE","description":"Harry Potter has learned to live with his bullying Uncle Vernon, his callous Aunt Petunia and the constant whining of his greedy, spoiled cousin Dudley. He's even learned to live with sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs. Harry's relatives have just as reluctantly learned to live with the unwelcome presence of their orphaned relation, a constant reminder of Petunia's \"wayward\" sister and brother-in-law and their mysterious and untimely demise. Even the impending arrival of his 11th birthday offers no excitement for Harry- as usual, there's little chance of cards, presents or any kind of birthday treat. This year, however, is different. On his 11th birthday, Harry learns that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. Invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime.

Ravdo) and modest single mother Ona (E. Ozarinskaitė) are passionate cooks trapped in the Kaunas canteen \"Tasty\". One day, without Ona's consent, Saulė involves them in a culinary reality show, the main prize of which is their own restaurant. Saulė lies to the jury about her origins and claims that they are both qualified chefs from the restaurant ‚La TASTY‘.\n\nAlthough the TASTY team is initially seen as a joke, their simple but brilliant recipes help them to become the viewers' favourites. Despite their success, tensions between the friends begin to rise as Ona receives more and more attention from the audience and from judge Emanuel (L. Pobedonoscevas). The celebrity chef of the competition, Bruknė (L. Rastokaitė), seizes the opportunity and tries to drive them further apart.

Harry's relatives have just as reluctantly learned to live with the unwelcome presence of their orphaned relation, a constant reminder of Petunia's \"wayward\" sister and brother-in-law and their mysterious and untimely demise. Even the impending arrival of his 11th birthday offers no excitement for Harry- as usual, there's little chance of cards, presents or any kind of birthday treat. This year, however, is different. On his 11th birthday, Harry learns that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. Invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime.

He's even learned to live with sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs. Harry's relatives have just as reluctantly learned to live with the unwelcome presence of their orphaned relation, a constant reminder of Petunia's \"wayward\" sister and brother-in-law and their mysterious and untimely demise. Even the impending arrival of his 11th birthday offers no excitement for Harry- as usual, there's little chance of cards, presents or any kind of birthday treat. This year, however, is different. On his 11th birthday, Harry learns that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. Invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime. At Hogwarts, he finds the home and family he has never had.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HARRYPOTTERANDTHEPHILOSOPHERSSTONE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=m9ZHSQPgSpyoMQkzUHQJL%2Fh406KtIaE9ew0zZO1VedlUfM1i%2BN6o3rJrYyZFhl7C1R6maAvt7mxsrR62nSjQrBF%2FN1IJToDw6F3W5ucejmO0sZLweiURSA73DLkzHrQYXWWUYHFMl9v33jZzV8k8HwJnhS6zRkK%2FkZfzq7hhuO2QFL9y3dDilWt0nb3EdNamsGx1QPX6EZisN0EpDSqSqUoQBe0lZokHLs0nKcJlDA%2FgpPOnK8fXEHomcDpGXRbu8GJEEawVVYXN%2FwHPc8HK2N48Ekl1XiljiEtYvlSKtTAI15ADyCq6GjkWuhEtn0C57yiVsF7z62W02B0jjKZwqg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":152,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT

Q&A","description":"Meet Matt Edwards, a lower-limb amputee boxer determined to break barriers and obtain his amateur boxing license—the crucial first step toward his dream of becoming a professional fighter. But the real fight isn’t just in the ring; it’s against a system that continues to put up obstacles, reflecting the everyday struggles disabled people face simply to be included in society.\n\nFeaturing leading disability advocates such as Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson and 'Fury the Gladiator' (Jodie Ounsley), Fighters not only tells Matt’s story but educates and challenges a non-disabled audience to confront the deep-rooted inequalities disabled people still battle today.\nDespite living in an era of progress, disabled people are still fighting for inclusion—whether in sports, broadcasting, the arts, government, media, or business. While many have made a powerful impact, others continue to face unnecessary barriers to equality.\n\nFighters is more than just a film—it’s a wake-up call. A powerful, real-life portrayal of one man’s relentless pursuit of acceptance and an inspiring testament to the strength of the human spirit.\n\nThis is a film that needs to be seen—not just by the disabled community, but by everyone—because if you want something bad enough, you might just have to fight for it. A recorded Q&A will play after the film.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FIGHTERSQA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=RP9VXlRO2rCeBailxI0wyIVD4Jpcat4wpaSRx4mGqkeTQtLIbgseB0kDs8L1t%2FcEk336ahR%2BwQ09U7ce3OxjXBxYFwMVpBTS9Q1RFQRGX6OlsMRA62%2FDqW5GN5bfS%2Fwq50J%2F6%2BTVdntlqLF1oCVhXIKWgOk9raiyMeBKOsIdQ4FgPChWfhCr%2F%2F%2Bw8OqovyWWET4YXb%2BON7lYUoj0ZispXXrHav26y%2FvQvjMDX1aOaovZ6DWPCNdii5yi9FBvS6PdrC5PjfBXG8aNCEJj96DDS8RUh17Hx5QHyieTHRfiEf8s53raK7MyBrekCqyIAoxDgYmTGkTphu6gNu%2FYuV%2Fs3g%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":75,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 23 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-23T18:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-81760"}]}]},{"title":"TANGERINE","description":"It's Christmas Eve in Tinseltown and Sin-Dee (newcomer Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) is back on the block.

Determined to save their home--not to mention his own--Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona to be Farquaad's bride.

Not only has he had to put up with his overbearing Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon Dursley and their dread of his magical abilities, but also it seems as if Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger have forgotten him, as they haven't replied to a single one of his letters. Then, suddenly and mysteriously, house-elf Dobby appears in Harry's bedroom and warns him of great danger if he should attempt to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But despite the elf's mischievous efforts to thwart Harry's return to school, the ever-determined Harry is rescued from the Dursley's dreary clutches by Ron and his brothers and whisked into the warmth of the Weasley household. Upon arriving at Hogwarts, Harry finds that his first year heroics have caused him to become the center of much unwanted attention. His new fans include Ron's little sister Ginny; first year would-be photographer Colin Creevey; and most irritatingly, the New Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Gilderoy Lockhart. Outshone only by his own vanity, Lockhart craves the attention that Harry shuns.

Woolf Works is a collage of themes from Mrs Dalloway, Orlando, The Waves and Woolf’s other writings.

When she discovers that he is actually a nobleman promised to another, she kills herself in despair. Her spirit joins the Wilis: the vengeful ghosts of women hell-bent on killing any man who crosses their path in a dance to the death. Wracked with guilt, Albrecht visits Giselle’s grave, where he must face the Wilis – and Giselle’s ghost. \nPeter Wright’s 1985 production of this quintessential Romantic ballet is a classic of The Royal Ballet repertory. Set to Adolphe Adam’s evocative score and with atmospheric designs by John Macfarlane, Giselle conjures up the earthly and otherworldly realms in a tale of love, betrayal and redemption.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":null,"length_in_minutes":210,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 03 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2026-03-03T19:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=297430&lang=en"}]}]}]}]}}
