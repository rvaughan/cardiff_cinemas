As Blade battles Frost and his army, he must confront his own identity and the darkness within him.","rating":null,"image_link":null,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 21 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-21T22:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39468"}]}],"length_in_minutes":115},{"title":"BONHOEFFER","description":"Berlin during the Third Reich, examining Bonhoeffer's determination to live his life with uncompromising political and spiritual courage, while speaking truth to power, in his attempt to save countless Jewish lives.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BONHOEFFER.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=VCDrhaXiPTLAKo28FS3HV0ir0E66G%2FOXnS6X6cbDQr%2BD3Csajdaf6gk7Svi%2BVVXopwD9QoIK3oOyKWbexc0rx6MsjPPTIrsWf%2Br16N0qKG2LkQ9CE4pnq6JTEcBl%2FdX0Jt3k75jTzjlzPaXgeTdNvdavvd3qoe8qonEl511UKtnMLbDsxO%2BG%2FTmMQkKh2aKh%2FqZ%2F7xAc%2FyYRcweKs8N1QMHOEMxzXJzDWel2tpNH91scTKJceuvKhnjTHzvB%2BynKduV6JtfWQHek2kL7DwGPFn9kdoqm5xBfm0JrqXrXq3DK8AvTlt9PxbwNXWYib4mpyFdwqQkjvvrdi1RSrL7GVg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 07 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-07T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75640"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 08 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-08T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75641"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 09 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-09T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75643"}]}],"length_in_minutes":132},{"title":"BONNIE & CLYDE THE MUSICAL","description":"Starring Tony-Nominee Jeremy Jordan and Olivier-Nominee Frances Mayli McCann, this award-winning production (including Best New Musical - What’s On Stage Awards 2023) re-tells the unbelievable true story of America's most infamous couple, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH

spectacular sculptures and paintings of Michelangelo seem so familiar to us, but what do we really know about this Renaissance giant? Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37640"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37639"}]}],"length_in_minutes":91},{"title":"EXHIBITION ON SCREEN: THE DAWN OF IMPRESSIONISM - PARIS, 1874","description":"The Impressionists are the most popular group in art history - millions flock every year to marvel at their masterpieces. But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.\n\nWhat led to that first ground-breaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874. See the show that changed everything on the big screen.\n\nMade in close collaboration with the Musee d’Orsay and National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.","rating":"PG","image_link":null,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 18 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-18T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37637"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 19 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-19T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37636"}]}],"length_in_minutes":90},{"title":"FLIGHT RISK","description":"In this high-stakes suspense thriller, Academy Award® nominee Mark Wahlberg (Best Supporting Actor, The Departed, 2006) plays a pilot transporting an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) accompanying a fugitive (Topher Grace) to trial.

With the support of William’s quirky group of friends, including his eccentric flatmate Spike (Rhys Ifans), he learns that taking a chance on love might be the greatest adventure of all.\n\nScreening on Sundays and Tuesdays as part of our Throwback Season where we revisit classics.

Pauline had a difficult upbringing and joining the 2-Tone music movement in 1979 was the perfect catalyst; enabling her to explore and express all sides of herself.\n\nLooking back at her own ground-breaking experience in this feature documentary, Pauline traces how her legacy came about and how it is relevant to the world today, especially where society pushes the boundaries of gender, politics, race and identity.\n\n\n\nPauline, of mixed Nigerian and Jewish heritage, was adopted into a white family in Essex in the 50’s. Her upbringing was defined by casual racism from within her own family. Pauline went on to find her own identity in the Coventry 2-Tone music scene and The Selecter was a reflection of working-class life in Thatcher's Britain, their music as social reportage and with an ethos of anti-racism and anti-sexism.\n\n\n\nThis is a cinematic and visceral documentary mixing intimate actuality, archive and interviews and a storming soundtrack. Contributors include Arthur ‘Gaps’ Hendrickson, Don Letts, Skin, Damon Albarn, Rhoda Dakar, Lynval Golding, Mykaell Riley, Sonia Boyce and Jools Holland.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/PAULINEBLACK%3AA2TONESTORY%2BQ%26A.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=xHbsu2YSmFoqoc8f6z2%2Bs0hcxvc5RKTmOISCj2sFwm3MmApCZaTaBEImZemuUcTg1aixioiVPj0hKBhP0lekXQy0%2BMadBHh69VgOvnkRia1ttZ%2BEq8eoPY81r8Yvxe%2FHz3ejeCGW4lU4wGkEI1vTI5sVLICPNI44xy%2Bfv8VsYyzUPK%2BCSLkbn4fI51vzeXnVBMtISUJB21icdgKqCJCqLEkoOr8Ak%2BXQ7GtdbTpwtKsackKoZTa1OHpp0Svsl3A1xWuhczc%2F12jrfTOMTMJOxmLuoO0oEdTIdnGsDsCNQ8H9Sq6%2F%2FUHuL2m%2FTUgMdcpApzNv5BJkSS9UN9x4agjzaA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 18 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-18T19:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75991"}]}],"length_in_minutes":107},{"title":"PIEP*ZYĆ MICKIEWICZA 2","description":"It's time for the return of the rebellious crew from IIIB and their unconventional teacher Jan Sienkiewicz!

Fuelled by such unforgettable songs as “Me and Bobby McGee,” “Piece of My Heart”, “Mercedes Benz”, “Cry Baby” and “Summertime”, a remarkable cast and breakout performances.

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.\n\nWhat led to that first ground-breaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874.

Pauline had a difficult upbringing and joining the 2-Tone music movement in 1979 was the perfect catalyst; enabling her to explore and express all sides of herself.\n\nLooking back at her own ground-breaking experience in this feature documentary, Pauline traces how her legacy came about and how it is relevant to the world today, especially where society pushes the boundaries of gender, politics, race and identity.\n\n\n\nPauline, of mixed Nigerian and Jewish heritage, was adopted into a white family in Essex in the 50’s. Her upbringing was defined by casual racism from within her own family. Pauline went on to find her own identity in the Coventry 2-Tone music scene and The Selecter was a reflection of working-class life in Thatcher's Britain, their music as social reportage and with an ethos of anti-racism and anti-sexism.\n\n\n\nThis is a cinematic and visceral documentary mixing intimate actuality, archive and interviews and a storming soundtrack. Contributors include Arthur ‘Gaps’ Hendrickson, Don Letts, Skin, Damon Albarn, Rhoda Dakar, Lynval Golding, Mykaell Riley, Sonia Boyce and Jools Holland.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/PAULINEBLACK%3AA2TONESTORY%2BQ%26A.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=xHbsu2YSmFoqoc8f6z2%2Bs0hcxvc5RKTmOISCj2sFwm3MmApCZaTaBEImZemuUcTg1aixioiVPj0hKBhP0lekXQy0%2BMadBHh69VgOvnkRia1ttZ%2BEq8eoPY81r8Yvxe%2FHz3ejeCGW4lU4wGkEI1vTI5sVLICPNI44xy%2Bfv8VsYyzUPK%2BCSLkbn4fI51vzeXnVBMtISUJB21icdgKqCJCqLEkoOr8Ak%2BXQ7GtdbTpwtKsackKoZTa1OHpp0Svsl3A1xWuhczc%2F12jrfTOMTMJOxmLuoO0oEdTIdnGsDsCNQ8H9Sq6%2F%2FUHuL2m%2FTUgMdcpApzNv5BJkSS9UN9x4agjzaA%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":107,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 18 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-18T19:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75991"}]}]},{"title":"THE METROPOLITAN OPERA: FIDELIO","description":"Following a string of awe-inspiring Met performances, soprano Lise Davidsen stars as Leonore, who risks everything to save her husband from the clutches of tyranny.

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.\n\nWhat led to that first ground-breaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874. See the show that changed everything on the big screen.\n\nMade in close collaboration with the Musee d’Orsay and National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.","rating":"PG","image_link":null,"length_in_minutes":90,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 19 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-19T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37636"}]}]},{"title":"HANS ZIMMER & FRIENDS: DIAMOND IN THE DESERT","description":"Hans Zimmer & Friends: Diamond in the Desert captures an extraordinary live performance of some of Zimmer's most revered compositions, including music from Dune, Gladiator, Interstellar, The Lion King, and much more.

The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 11 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-11T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291260&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-11T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291261&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 11 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-11T13:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148479"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-11T15:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148480"}]}]},{"title":"THE CHOSEN: LAST SUPPER PART 1","description":"Jesus rides into the holy city as king, but finds his Father’s house has been turned from a place of prayer into a corrupt market.
