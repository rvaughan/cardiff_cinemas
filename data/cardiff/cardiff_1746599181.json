Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37640"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37639"}]}],"length_in_minutes":91},{"title":"FANTASTIC MR.

Three thousand years ago, the greatest sailors in the world voyaged across the vast South Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, for a millennium, their voyages stopped – and no one today knows why. From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes “Moana,” a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who sails out on a daring mission to save her people. During her journey, Moana (voice of Auliʻi Cravalho) meets the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson), who guides her in her quest to become a master wayfinder. Together, they sail across the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills the ancient quest of her ancestors and discovers the one thing she’s always sought: her own identity.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/MOANA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=Q4jlQd7pgowM5Ryj5mE6nAsNLO6lZMEwGAT2vVh5impsHAs16j5O1luPET%2BCKiVqhvf31nb7QNaXV0PMtO5XT3FHO4miBKE24XMHI4ckwis1W6upPsOtMOJntjoY81GlS5CfWQ8P1awAoI5%2BACpwwn6Athy%2BUJIusmhdffyCWnt2qZdWIRmy%2B4C05afLIDKgW60BZ7fkyxmSKEQE%2BI14VjwdJkLuRKij0lZAB323DhzNwg5A%2Bh6fstUqGlzLzfS3Y2AZyT72p0xZS3TEEPY%2BQfv6eG40h7DAGVvxURz2vTZcJ9wRde%2FnTCdQthhmE9lDqczZKONM54nXbPh8VRFshQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 18 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-18T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295195&lang=en"}]}],"length_in_minutes":108},{"title":"MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL","description":"","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/MONTYPYTHONANDTHEHOLYGRAIL.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=xx1XnFH2yCKMh%2F5KBHF%2B8dkKeilX4g2htgBPlNTJ05YSbpVyteeOprnfofcf32cgMqNgCy4hJBK822APsYO%2BAHs%2BGEvEu5Xpkmpzp%2BCMcL9NcHK0EWXbuxLK3AWDbnlMG7wBaHfV8LTS69roaHTVbjlxcPtZKPPzXq6NFyKZYcQiDE%2F8TMCRoUzQPKZAeHXNatOJB32ESt%2BgfceZzGVnE2As97WFvj9yyGmiN15oUYybtsWXfCPZ7BjA7nq0M2xK1jtv0Aak%2FcNn2ZBgM%2BRdOVyq1p02Kt73Bv8G3QeRmaPqS5VdbbOmBUVkLIqNpQWJdeEFgtMfm9b8ywQBiv8Y8w%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-07T15:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40836"},{"time":"2025-05-07T18:15:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020340/287582","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"time":"2025-05-07T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292912&lang=en"}]}],"length_in_minutes":92},{"title":"MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL 50TH ANN","description":"King Arthur and his knights embark on a low-budget search for the Grail, encountering many, very silly obstacles.

Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos.

The film humorously critiques Hollywood's beauty standards while celebrating the complexities of womanhood and explores the themes of motherhood, and self-discovery in Los Angeles.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEUNINVITED.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=N%2Br25RvGiPjPPC1%2BcCobTmlIzAGxkCmLfCDkemPQaUfs6whHSv01XX9Y5b9RRrT30g7V1gOxVdHgkGPmhrx7jRkZ%2Fj3KF%2FN7YMeVBV1OUJfDV%2FgK7plmjPoIrb%2Bu1z%2FsYlaZJ51O3zNfYooPxhEMtyPHbnwIMkViLLqs06k80IHm4JgHzrwQvzMHprzv6navaovGCrOeQnl4qJol0ZdtM6xGttsLxfNRREdNrmLln4wkS%2BGLxcJcobOVfYVvpr6brso8lhEMwo96s8YIkqPgGbAxnOvZAfirPSj9GK45EUY%2FFi6Q8hXBNPrNBIe%2Bb0PdVdiM0GXxZvk4gkuEr%2FhPMQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 11 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-11T16:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77925"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 13 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-13T18:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77926"}]}],"length_in_minutes":98},{"title":"THOMAS & FRIENDS: JOURNEY BEYOND SODOR","description":"Let your little ones experience the magic of cinema with our mini-movies!\n\nThomas and his friends travel to the mainland to save James and show that friendship is more important than being the favourite engine.

Times+ preview screening of The Salt Path, a moving adaptation of the best-selling memoir by Raynor Winn.\n\nThe Salt Path is the profound true story of husband and wife, Raynor and Moth Winn’s 630-mile trek along the beautiful but rugged Cornish, Devon and Dorset coastline.\n\nAfter being forcibly removed from their home, they make the desperate decision to walk in the hope that, in nature, they will find solace and a sense of acceptance. With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination. The Salt Path is a journey that is exhilarating, challenging, and liberating in equal measure. A portrayal of home, how it can be lost and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.\n\nEach ticket includes a complimentary popcorn.","rating":"12A","image_link":null,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 29 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-29T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41308"}]}],"length_in_minutes":115},{"title":"UNTIL DAWN","description":"One year after her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers.

The production showcases bespoke instruments, including a magnetic harp, a circular flute, an aluphone, and a reverb chamber, and Björk is furthermore joined on stage by musical director and multi-instrumentalist Bergur Þórisson, percussionist Manu Delago, flute septet Viibra, harpist Katie Buckley and the Hamrahlid choir. Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton-Jones.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BJ%C3%96RK%3ACORNUCOPIA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=uk23f%2FKtU2kDFftu9tL01hL1J%2BBDmugvxZ2w2MOj%2FETtyCqnZzKEUbEFQEMRTFxdamo%2BC8hr8qjgGa39f%2BK%2BfgAQUWa9gYWT%2BBtV25%2BvtjkgJaJny62SEk%2BIgOX4aO0yLOZyhiZJZ3gR8x1WJQ7o0mPkNeFFlX8Nd%2Bars4juDUmDPf9bKBR%2FRg9BFJP7IaFXlHWok3nA06L8VtWxUdXjcGVwFKuOafBnqHnd3kkTA6t%2BRXQwpVMgNZ0GyaIzrJO1SkdstaoCNradjlJZeuWSow418mbMEocQC0Rupxci%2BQ8k4TCImNYEiIMaHOMAYSxx3gIE%2B%2BgirJS%2BDFWDxNg85w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":120,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-07T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40397"},{"time":"2025-05-07T18:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40201"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET’S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"Bluey at the Cinema: Let’s Play Chef Collection is an hour-long treat for fans of Bluey to enjoy, made up of eight episodes from the TV show’s three series, all based around the fun of food!

The production showcases bespoke instruments, including a magnetic harp, a circular flute, an aluphone, and a reverb chamber, and Björk is furthermore joined on stage by musical director and multi-instrumentalist Bergur Þórisson, percussionist Manu Delago, flute septet Viibra, harpist Katie Buckley and the Hamrahlid choir. Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton-Jones.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BJ%C3%96RK%3ACORNUCOPIA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=uk23f%2FKtU2kDFftu9tL01hL1J%2BBDmugvxZ2w2MOj%2FETtyCqnZzKEUbEFQEMRTFxdamo%2BC8hr8qjgGa39f%2BK%2BfgAQUWa9gYWT%2BBtV25%2BvtjkgJaJny62SEk%2BIgOX4aO0yLOZyhiZJZ3gR8x1WJQ7o0mPkNeFFlX8Nd%2Bars4juDUmDPf9bKBR%2FRg9BFJP7IaFXlHWok3nA06L8VtWxUdXjcGVwFKuOafBnqHnd3kkTA6t%2BRXQwpVMgNZ0GyaIzrJO1SkdstaoCNradjlJZeuWSow418mbMEocQC0Rupxci%2BQ8k4TCImNYEiIMaHOMAYSxx3gIE%2B%2BgirJS%2BDFWDxNg85w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":120,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 10 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-10T12:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41254"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET’S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"Bluey at the Cinema: Let’s Play Chef Collection is an hour-long treat for fans of Bluey to enjoy, made up of eight episodes from the TV show’s three series, all based around the fun of food!

Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release.

But then, for a millennium, their voyages stopped – and no one today knows why. From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes “Moana,” a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who sails out on a daring mission to save her people. During her journey, Moana (voice of Auliʻi Cravalho) meets the mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson), who guides her in her quest to become a master wayfinder. Together, they sail across the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous monsters and impossible odds, and along the way, Moana fulfills the ancient quest of her ancestors and discovers the one thing she’s always sought: her own identity.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/MOANA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=Q4jlQd7pgowM5Ryj5mE6nAsNLO6lZMEwGAT2vVh5impsHAs16j5O1luPET%2BCKiVqhvf31nb7QNaXV0PMtO5XT3FHO4miBKE24XMHI4ckwis1W6upPsOtMOJntjoY81GlS5CfWQ8P1awAoI5%2BACpwwn6Athy%2BUJIusmhdffyCWnt2qZdWIRmy%2B4C05afLIDKgW60BZ7fkyxmSKEQE%2BI14VjwdJkLuRKij0lZAB323DhzNwg5A%2Bh6fstUqGlzLzfS3Y2AZyT72p0xZS3TEEPY%2BQfv6eG40h7DAGVvxURz2vTZcJ9wRde%2FnTCdQthhmE9lDqczZKONM54nXbPh8VRFshQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":108,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 18 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-18T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=295195&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"PADDINGTON","description":"Discover Paddington in 4DX for the very first time on Sunday May 18 at Cineworld’s 4DX Family Day and grab a 4DX Ticket for just £4/€4 per person.

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37640"}]}]},{"title":"FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES","description":"Plagued by a violent recurring nightmare, college student Stefanie heads home to track down the one person who might be able to break the cycle and save her family...","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINALDESTINATION%3ABLOODLINES.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=l%2FsjVbf7vE2Ss5pYF67BFFuBa%2B3zu3mA9r7tCnWb2WUNUAjMPMsfeQxfo1mGGDSQ8f1IPqUqrZht4ONDgwqwegBGT6Pwhs%2Bp9XIrv3ER%2FthXRzoWkiaZ4Fg%2B80lXPSZMfnD%2B7GkGbZRFQRS0eWLWMSD%2FWqiCKsIUUYf7T7Xm5v%2BtMrG8aiPUpatrgJUkdFUf26YbeXdXEgpZD7stU%2BTJLOYkjExWfl4xT3rfU3kWLVz6nO8ZvdCAztyjPTtf4kwPurR7sXcikc6WgF3XjI9ZknSTWNX4tdaqtQsoEHnAy1SsJtACdvnonde3cutBLiyw77vVFUQpVOMNWTCM1jYOuQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":110,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152240"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T11:20:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152336"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T13:10:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152239"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152335"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T15:50:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152238"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T16:35:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152338"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T19:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152337"}]}]},{"title":"HURRY UP TOMORROW","description":"A musician struggling with the strain of touring connects with an enigmatic fan in this US drama.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HURRYUPTOMORROW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=UwtODgApXL9uf%2Fqk5jMSWOGQhiahZFXSKJJ7oPTnPnvN4TETSQtEodQGN7j%2FrpvYeQ6KDsFBLaYr8M0EBT3mNbHktSzrakKB1fYQKhg42QDHTnjo7PmYRCjAT93jB1A%2B6d7fNkW%2FmfX1r1kadKlRSBrLL9rQRxWVeSOkSTTUkd%2F4oXavGhKsp%2FqdQl%2BpmlGwo9sEUQeLlcYoD5oHyClpKpdx%2FStWpBhk97zFp%2B8DMSkcXrPBZQuELi2Jd%2FJXITSUrNYFhxgl3owrwxvd19A44fIgVAhwWcjlHA2FMcklvozxtF82LgnlvQfb1%2FXt%2FHH7q0H1KtzRZQHAy9rmCXHjcw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":105,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T15:40:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151840"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T18:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151841"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T20:50:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151839"}]}]},{"title":"JAFAICAN + Q&A WITH PETER ANDRE AND FREDI NWAKA","description":"Gazza, a small-time crook, seeks £35,000 for his gran's care.

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU

With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination. The Salt Path is a journey that is exhilarating, challenging, and liberating in equal measure. A portrayal of home, how it can be lost and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.\n\nEach ticket includes a complimentary popcorn.","rating":"12A","image_link":null,"length_in_minutes":115,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 29 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-29T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41308"}]}]}]},{"tab_date_label":"FRI 30 MAY","film_data":[{"title":"PEPPA MEETS THE BABY CINEMA EXPERIENCE","description":"PIG changes are coming!
