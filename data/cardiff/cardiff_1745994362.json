The production showcases bespoke instruments, including a magnetic harp, a circular flute, an aluphone, and a reverb chamber, and Björk is furthermore joined on stage by musical director and multi-instrumentalist Bergur Þórisson, percussionist Manu Delago, flute septet Viibra, harpist Katie Buckley and the Hamrahlid choir. Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick

Drop is jointly produced by blockbuster genre houses Blumhouse and Platinum Dunes.\n\nEmmy nominee Meghann Fahy, breakout star of White Lotus and The Perfect Couple, plays Violet, a widowed mother on her first date in years, who arrives at an upscale restaurant where she is relieved that her date, Henry (It Ends with Us’ Brandon Sklenar) is more charming and handsome than she expected.

Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37640"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37639"}]}],"length_in_minutes":91},{"title":"FINAL DESTINATION + FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES","description":"","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINALDESTINATION%2BFINALDESTINATION%3ABLOODLINES.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=LQJBxv7Jgz8xvK7gNLP7ftnheM9yI6nM%2BdVAUDOPLveWxOjm2B6tRG4qnL8CljYjyARRHv4BGCuUmW5A5UkT0TuHqac6L3AXlqOkVA0mI%2FK65%2F7I8VNy5McS%2BeeJWVhxb05ZYgTCrG0YXEtuFzNHOypv8aXaeftqnEKjomuOktkKnG9PO6gbyFi1gKBeHuu9p1fTBqTjwM9vpDywgrx0%2BfzkbYDqzbo4Ary%2BlSPksghl4PEGJn%2BgFGFHrzDbV5NBDzyaZ%2FUs8%2BFP%2F4pN8nl%2BNelbWv5QK5wh998hbbeyS39uu7Wn5MBQUoF5az77Ko1HRZhf%2FVvCB6E5q1NM0fH48g%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 09 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-09T18:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294668&lang=en"}]}],"length_in_minutes":219},{"title":"FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES","description":"The newest chapter in New Line Cinema’s bloody successful franchise takes audiences back to the very beginning of Death’s twisted sense of justice.

with enhanced audio. \nSet in the hauntingly beautiful ruins of the ancient Roman Amphitheater in Pompeii, Italy, the film captures Pink Floyd performing an intimate concert without an audience. Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release.

at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n Watched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-30T12:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294412&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-04-30T14:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79181"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-01T11:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79254"},{"time":"2025-05-01T12:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294562&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-01T13:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79251"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 02 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-02T11:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79630"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 03 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-03T11:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79632"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 06 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-06T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79633"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 07 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-07T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79681"}]}],"length_in_minutes":95},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"SIX The Musical – Live! on the Big Screen at Showcase Cinemas!\n\nWest End sensation Six The Musical is making its way to the big screen, offering audiences a dazzling cinematic experience of the Tony Award-winning production.

The film humorously critiques Hollywood's beauty standards while celebrating the complexities of womanhood and explores the themes of motherhood, and self-discovery in Los Angeles.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEUNINVITED.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=N%2Br25RvGiPjPPC1%2BcCobTmlIzAGxkCmLfCDkemPQaUfs6whHSv01XX9Y5b9RRrT30g7V1gOxVdHgkGPmhrx7jRkZ%2Fj3KF%2FN7YMeVBV1OUJfDV%2FgK7plmjPoIrb%2Bu1z%2FsYlaZJ51O3zNfYooPxhEMtyPHbnwIMkViLLqs06k80IHm4JgHzrwQvzMHprzv6navaovGCrOeQnl4qJol0ZdtM6xGttsLxfNRREdNrmLln4wkS%2BGLxcJcobOVfYVvpr6brso8lhEMwo96s8YIkqPgGbAxnOvZAfirPSj9GK45EUY%2FFi6Q8hXBNPrNBIe%2Bb0PdVdiM0GXxZvk4gkuEr%2FhPMQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 11 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-11T16:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77925"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 13 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-13T18:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77926"}]}],"length_in_minutes":98},{"title":"THE WILD ROBOT","description":"The Wild Robot” follows Rozzum 7134 (“Roz” for short), a futuristic robot that washes ashore on a deserted island.

her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they find themselves stalked by a masked killer and horrifically murdered one by one…only to wake up and find themselves back at the beginning of the same evening. Trapped in the valley, they’re forced to relive the nightmare again and again - only each time the killer threat is different, each more terrifying than the last. Hope dwindling, the group soon realizes they have a limited number of deaths left, and the only way to escape is to survive until dawn.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/UNTILDAWN.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=1vUjlYxuEBPcCY3mk2CFstrTAbmMydoX4aWq8h6PBCq426jjdtIC28GfPYCz%2F9JXES5fYMFqiHC0I8%2FHhLfXbmP6gs%2Fp2gzs4GB8hptNwFis6knyW1TNndPFKxc8aXS2QSDxOLJ686XHLHNzaknKfMKRbqtFq64k0iLyCSxq55ZypzsjxjZYaGQ7mYchkYNC6VXXcLKd4P9vX459sbQ0rPg9L9Tc805l6x5ASZz3PUBXqinlxVCS1xkk6w%2F%2FUj7P4P4gTcPmYM0T%2BDx4KWGdTk8VnbJvVSfVqTrSn5vYCr%2BU%2B9O2NejM9Ivy6IyAXPTcmxQD1Fi6ozwn5EZ1u77sRg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase

The film delves into the experiences of those who travel solely by harnessing the natural elements alone, following a diverse array of traditional boats and uncovering the unique rhythms and motivations of engineless navigation.\n\nJourneying through rivers, coastlines, and open seas, spanning the UK, the Netherlands, and France, Wind, Tide & Oar creates a contemplative space, addressing themes of ecology, heritage, traditional skills, and maritime history. Using a 1960s hand-wound camera, Wahl offers a poetic and intimate perspective on a millennia-old craft, upended by the invention of mechanised power.\n\nThrough the film’s reveries, sailing becomes a means to explore our interaction with and responsibility to the environment. It invites deep reflection on our relationship with nature, our understanding of and commitment to sustainability, and our care for the world around us.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/WIND%2CTIDE%26OAR.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KI%2BduxQzYkqQbjfc5sD7kpUDFV1Eni%2By3ckzIiGN5ZWqrCf1iT9rcEXWt9OV7jDPwLKYLBuo9kMlsro21PH2j0EZa%2BnImVVN6SXkaf6eRWpLes5k%2FFhxJUICspJnxIfyhVd4nkL2P0EGC5NRUBlVScytNICduLoLe1Y4Gp5aai6elwfQgCag%2BThgtdaOjzdb%2BHZzebTvBYkuEl7AMehPQXz62R7N%2Fif90YdfSmZhUkFrlSpLjn1m6ieHTCb5yrv%2BA0MOu8Y02UbeM3jpwOk2rU1rew3X4RJjSSLmoKSPrnHkdVqSimiuf%2B7lUhsW3BzqTcTyJoW9CgzPE7A%2BG7onGw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-30T18:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-30T08:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40917"}]}]},{"title":"GOLDBEAK","description":"Kitty Jinbao, who lost his parents, left the chicken village and was raised by a kind-hearted mother chicken.

Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release. Inspired by the golden warmth of Pompeii’s iconic setting, the remaster transforms this timeless piece into a masterpiece of sight and sound.

exploration of engineless sailing, shot on analogue film over three years. The film delves into the experiences of those who travel solely by harnessing the natural elements alone, following a diverse array of traditional boats and uncovering the unique rhythms and motivations of engineless navigation.\n\nJourneying through rivers, coastlines, and open seas, spanning the UK, the Netherlands, and France, Wind, Tide & Oar creates a contemplative space, addressing themes of ecology, heritage, traditional skills, and maritime history. Using a 1960s hand-wound camera, Wahl offers a poetic and intimate perspective on a millennia-old craft, upended by the invention of mechanised power.\n\nThrough the film’s reveries, sailing becomes a means to explore our interaction with and responsibility to the environment. It invites deep reflection on our relationship with nature, our understanding of and commitment to sustainability, and our care for the world around us.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/WIND%2CTIDE%26OAR.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KI%2BduxQzYkqQbjfc5sD7kpUDFV1Eni%2By3ckzIiGN5ZWqrCf1iT9rcEXWt9OV7jDPwLKYLBuo9kMlsro21PH2j0EZa%2BnImVVN6SXkaf6eRWpLes5k%2FFhxJUICspJnxIfyhVd4nkL2P0EGC5NRUBlVScytNICduLoLe1Y4Gp5aai6elwfQgCag%2BThgtdaOjzdb%2BHZzebTvBYkuEl7AMehPQXz62R7N%2Fif90YdfSmZhUkFrlSpLjn1m6ieHTCb5yrv%2BA0MOu8Y02UbeM3jpwOk2rU1rew3X4RJjSSLmoKSPrnHkdVqSimiuf%2B7lUhsW3BzqTcTyJoW9CgzPE7A%2BG7onGw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":84,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-30T18:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-01T11:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79255"}]}]},{"title":"GOLDBEAK","description":"Kitty Jinbao, who lost his parents, left the chicken village and was raised by a kind-hearted mother chicken.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-01T11:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79254"},{"time":"2025-05-01T12:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294562&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-01T13:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79251"}]}]},{"title":"SYLVANIAN FAMILIES: THE MOVIE","description":"The annual Star Festival arrives in Sylvanian Village again this year.

reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 02 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-02T11:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79630"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"SIX The Musical – Live! on the Big Screen at Showcase Cinemas!\n\nWest End sensation Six The Musical is making its way to the big screen, offering audiences a dazzling cinematic experience of the Tony Award-winning production.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 03 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-03T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79432"}]}]},{"title":"GOLDBEAK","description":"Kitty Jinbao, who lost his parents, left the chicken village and was raised by a kind-hearted mother chicken.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 04 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-04T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79509"}]}]},{"title":"GOLDBEAK","description":"Kitty Jinbao, who lost his parents, left the chicken village and was raised by a kind-hearted mother chicken.

Eddie, the rebellious chicken sister, follows Jinbao on an adventure together. In Bird City, Jinbao finally found his relatives and learned that he was from an extraordinary background.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 05 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-05T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79573"}]}]},{"title":"GOLDBEAK","description":"Kitty Jinbao, who lost his parents, left the chicken village and was raised by a kind-hearted mother chicken.

 features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 06 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-06T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79633"}]}]},{"title":"SYLVANIAN FAMILIES: THE MOVIE","description":"The annual Star Festival arrives in Sylvanian Village again this year.

mesmerised audiences worldwide for five years.\n\nThis unique cinematic experience immerses viewers in Björk’s spectacular stage production, featuring a setlist spanning her iconic early works to the visionary Utopia (2017) and Fossora (2023). The production showcases bespoke instruments, including a magnetic harp, a circular flute, an aluphone, and a reverb chamber, and Björk is furthermore joined on stage by musical director and multi-instrumentalist Bergur Þórisson, percussionist Manu Delago, flute septet Viibra, harpist Katie Buckley and the Hamrahlid choir. Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton-Jones.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BJ%C3%96RK%3ACORNUCOPIA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=uk23f%2FKtU2kDFftu9tL01hL1J%2BBDmugvxZ2w2MOj%2FETtyCqnZzKEUbEFQEMRTFxdamo%2BC8hr8qjgGa39f%2BK%2BfgAQUWa9gYWT%2BBtV25%2BvtjkgJaJny62SEk%2BIgOX4aO0yLOZyhiZJZ3gR8x1WJQ7o0mPkNeFFlX8Nd%2Bars4juDUmDPf9bKBR%2FRg9BFJP7IaFXlHWok3nA06L8VtWxUdXjcGVwFKuOafBnqHnd3kkTA6t%2BRXQwpVMgNZ0GyaIzrJO1SkdstaoCNradjlJZeuWSow418mbMEocQC0Rupxci%2BQ8k4TCImNYEiIMaHOMAYSxx3gIE%2B%2BgirJS%2BDFWDxNg85w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":120,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 07 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-07T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40397"},{"time":"2025-05-07T18:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40201"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET'S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BLUEYATTHECINEMA%3ALET%27SPLAYCHEFCOLLECTION.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=XeUJkQAKwHap64%2B1fPswL%2FAIsa0Tz6uFuYJ0fgRAoKVMEKtR5KhkyTsgMdfKQc1cUGU9YbVDewwsHMKYJGmyg2CvoAwZOaHbog9T%2FaFOGDp0zbU0qXCu6CAcDHWw9rYtqHh8RIipn4s42SZn8qLtDWUJsyolJp5grX9fExaKRoSzrd6UWl9oJPp6B58gWeSAlpE%2F%2FysE%2B8pUPY5m708y7IYeDxsU0gwC269zjgLHgD%2Bvfl9A0tWjyVIRCWdyBzMTtbfEVGscWPUVLxyQKJzeasS8DkLlmM8ZoNUPfcJ1yTE5WeQB5z9pDS%2FCJJw23zPwCpgtaQpk2exbdrCdVdMffQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":60,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 07 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-07T12:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=294904&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET’S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"Bluey at the Cinema: Let’s Play Chef Collection is an hour-long treat for fans of Bluey to enjoy, made up of eight episodes from the TV show’s three series, all based around the fun of food!

Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release. Inspired by the golden warmth of Pompeii’s iconic setting, the remaster transforms this timeless piece into a masterpiece of sight and sound.

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37640"}]}]},{"title":"FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES","description":"Plagued by a violent recurring nightmare, college student Stefanie heads home to track down the one person who might be able to break the cycle and save her family...","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINALDESTINATION%3ABLOODLINES.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=l%2FsjVbf7vE2Ss5pYF67BFFuBa%2B3zu3mA9r7tCnWb2WUNUAjMPMsfeQxfo1mGGDSQ8f1IPqUqrZht4ONDgwqwegBGT6Pwhs%2Bp9XIrv3ER%2FthXRzoWkiaZ4Fg%2B80lXPSZMfnD%2B7GkGbZRFQRS0eWLWMSD%2FWqiCKsIUUYf7T7Xm5v%2BtMrG8aiPUpatrgJUkdFUf26YbeXdXEgpZD7stU%2BTJLOYkjExWfl4xT3rfU3kWLVz6nO8ZvdCAztyjPTtf4kwPurR7sXcikc6WgF3XjI9ZknSTWNX4tdaqtQsoEHnAy1SsJtACdvnonde3cutBLiyw77vVFUQpVOMNWTCM1jYOuQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":110,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152240"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T11:20:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152336"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T13:10:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152239"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152335"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T15:50:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152238"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T16:35:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152338"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T19:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152337"}]}]},{"title":"HURRY UP TOMORROW","description":"A musician struggling with the strain of touring connects with an enigmatic fan in this US drama.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HURRYUPTOMORROW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=UwtODgApXL9uf%2Fqk5jMSWOGQhiahZFXSKJJ7oPTnPnvN4TETSQtEodQGN7j%2FrpvYeQ6KDsFBLaYr8M0EBT3mNbHktSzrakKB1fYQKhg42QDHTnjo7PmYRCjAT93jB1A%2B6d7fNkW%2FmfX1r1kadKlRSBrLL9rQRxWVeSOkSTTUkd%2F4oXavGhKsp%2FqdQl%2BpmlGwo9sEUQeLlcYoD5oHyClpKpdx%2FStWpBhk97zFp%2B8DMSkcXrPBZQuELi2Jd%2FJXITSUrNYFhxgl3owrwxvd19A44fIgVAhwWcjlHA2FMcklvozxtF82LgnlvQfb1%2FXt%2FHH7q0H1KtzRZQHAy9rmCXHjcw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":105,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T15:40:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151840"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T18:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151841"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-20T20:50:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151839"}]}]},{"title":"JAFAICAN + Q&A WITH PETER ANDRE AND FREDI NWAKA","description":"","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/JAFAICAN%2BQ%26AWITHPETERANDREANDFREDINWAKA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=gnTKmL9RI40ql4DBS%2F8p3qTIkB93qMVj90VBdhNB4OgRyhs6K5SPNuXxRLKhXTtxaBF3S71O565eXNF2nmd5QCzEnBTNkzKTUXA9kCP2TlYu64aJx2Mp3iEocqykrFSkNC0faTEXi0C4pUfuL%2Fv6QMKWIHHlNbTiaWsGCYEcGydrr1PD9ax6JNpi5O1uAQI2vPGvhTJ8jUnI4OR4Ha1EEoSvBYVfAQG%2FjMUjEKSRsH5K0TKADCzFpEeQHbFLVE4umye1Y3GdEMJ10nEu6who7Nzq6WQkDXlzM7JBDS8atp0FPEoX52OwgcCQAei77nagiuvY328ojxQbTapuvlqyEg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":116,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T18:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-79310"}]}]},{"title":"MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - THE FINAL RECKONING","description":"Our lives are the sum of our choices.

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37639"}]}]},{"title":"FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES","description":"Plagued by a violent recurring nightmare, college student Stefanie heads home to track down the one person who might be able to break the cycle and save her family...","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINALDESTINATION%3ABLOODLINES.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=l%2FsjVbf7vE2Ss5pYF67BFFuBa%2B3zu3mA9r7tCnWb2WUNUAjMPMsfeQxfo1mGGDSQ8f1IPqUqrZht4ONDgwqwegBGT6Pwhs%2Bp9XIrv3ER%2FthXRzoWkiaZ4Fg%2B80lXPSZMfnD%2B7GkGbZRFQRS0eWLWMSD%2FWqiCKsIUUYf7T7Xm5v%2BtMrG8aiPUpatrgJUkdFUf26YbeXdXEgpZD7stU%2BTJLOYkjExWfl4xT3rfU3kWLVz6nO8ZvdCAztyjPTtf4kwPurR7sXcikc6WgF3XjI9ZknSTWNX4tdaqtQsoEHnAy1SsJtACdvnonde3cutBLiyw77vVFUQpVOMNWTCM1jYOuQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":110,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-22T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152346"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-22T13:10:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152345"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-22T15:50:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152348"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-22T18:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152347"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-22T21:10:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/152344"}]}]},{"title":"HURRY UP TOMORROW","description":"A musician struggling with the strain of touring connects with an enigmatic fan in this US drama.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HURRYUPTOMORROW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=UwtODgApXL9uf%2Fqk5jMSWOGQhiahZFXSKJJ7oPTnPnvN4TETSQtEodQGN7j%2FrpvYeQ6KDsFBLaYr8M0EBT3mNbHktSzrakKB1fYQKhg42QDHTnjo7PmYRCjAT93jB1A%2B6d7fNkW%2FmfX1r1kadKlRSBrLL9rQRxWVeSOkSTTUkd%2F4oXavGhKsp%2FqdQl%2BpmlGwo9sEUQeLlcYoD5oHyClpKpdx%2FStWpBhk97zFp%2B8DMSkcXrPBZQuELi2Jd%2FJXITSUrNYFhxgl3owrwxvd19A44fIgVAhwWcjlHA2FMcklvozxtF82LgnlvQfb1%2FXt%2FHH7q0H1KtzRZQHAy9rmCXHjcw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":105,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-22T15:40:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151846"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-22T18:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151847"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-22T20:50:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151845"}]}]},{"title":"MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - THE FINAL RECKONING","description":"Our lives are the sum of our choices.
