show captured recently at the Sadler’s Wells Peacock Theatre is an extraordinary musical journey paying homage to Janis Joplin and her biggest musical influences. Like a comet that burns far too brightly to last, Janis Joplin exploded onto the music scene in 1967 and, almost overnight, became the queen of rock & roll. The unmistakable voice, filled with raw emotion and tinged with Southern Comfort, made her a must-see headliner from Monterey to Woodstock. Fuelled by such unforgettable songs as “Me and Bobby McGee,” “Piece of My Heart”, “Mercedes Benz”, “Cry Baby” and “Summertime”, a remarkable cast and breakout performances. A Night with Janis Joplin, written and directed by Randy Johnson, is a musical journey celebrating Janis and her biggest musical influences—icons like Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Odetta, Nina Simone and Bessie Smith, who inspired one of rock ‘n roll’s greatest legends.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ANIGHTWITHJANISJOPLIN%3ATHEMUSICAL.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=QkalYGJp0G9w6i8ezy%2FW77W1gLQ6R5g%2B%2B0VVyoDpZgvMMENTuOkxhLYnumH7FvjEel%2BkK01ajjpL%2BACOmXESQiSnAPnFOU9dLhQN0iLfBfOTURinMPBld5aWqRDOzmqCZn3aFzuFNnSxMu8AI22fCpKiCKiK3QL12Ybd7ex%2FgNqD5YmomSgP%2FQzK%2BXSnlzjm5yCBLimRZ%2BFBP6gQj7RszFM5YmOPnGqxyguKSMJM7qfjI0Q0V%2FGpdDntI3mRv9O6YOUao0tR8tqAZgqAEp%2BTa1nYfzvep%2FLA6YtqbhsImmLjwPtvVcUnIbAhUNZ56WW0i1mlA9eci8QcCIzGcLyNtw%3D%3D","screenings":[{"date":"THU 13 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-13T19:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/142694"},{"time":"2025-03-13T19:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37506"}]},{"date":"SUN 16 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-16T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/142696"}]}],"lengthInMinutes":140},{"title":"A REAL PAIN","description":"Mismatched cousins David (Jesse Eisenberg) and Benji (Kieran Culkin) reunite for a tour through Poland to honor their beloved grandmother.

And if it's a journey, then only in their favorite car from their youth. This opportunity arises, because the perfect Nysa appears in the son's (Mariusz Drężek) second-hand shop. However, the son and daughter-in-law (Anita Sokołowska) oppose the journey, so the seniors have no choice but to steal a car. The grandparents' crazy plan is supported by their granddaughter (Julia Wieniawa) and a spiteful neighbor (Wiktor Zborowski). Finally, Józek and Elżbieta travel on their own terms: they laugh, take risks, and love as if they were 20 years old.

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.\n\nWhat led to that first ground-breaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874. See the show that changed everything on the big screen.\n\nMade in close collaboration with the Musee d’Orsay and National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.","rating":null,"image_link":null,"screenings":[{"date":"TUE 18 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-18T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37637"}]},{"date":"WED 19 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-19T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37636"}]}],"lengthInMinutes":90},{"title":"FLIGHT RISK","description":"In this high-stakes suspense thriller, Academy Award® nominee Mark Wahlberg (Best Supporting Actor, The Departed, 2006) plays a pilot transporting an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) accompanying a fugitive (Topher Grace) to trial.

Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time.\n\nAt the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SEPTEMBER5.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KFQZzUFDcIkH%2BTtxrG%2BABQL3jIUSu2hZ47GeU6Nju2HAVE%2FWmlLs8mKzzBqwxmI2FCdDGrn1hhJSiv%2FEz1RKNFN2irq4WdxMhoHzmXEOJhNgaQzlumEYlW2bNzmNhccTSD1At%2FbBNjYfZiGlJ%2FcdHaA2%2Fy3PcLwcR1UlDOJVpqNLy%2FEm9bJw1FryW8DkghfWZ3zfSK8LLbVmLe%2B4%2BRosKPzgNIsPHTT4AmeI%2Bz8OabWo6xfFsVZ%2F0GBeBr3IbeajV4k4ODsCup2dpNTcFq4SAYG0flXiKIW2lRvwczzKca0bt9wnypV7PToGDzz%2BwzOYPws%2Bh63pldMJVyWZiSjFvw%3D%3D","screenings":[{"date":"MON

And if it's a journey, then only in their favorite car from their youth. This opportunity arises, because the perfect Nysa appears in the son's (Mariusz Drężek) second-hand shop. However, the son and daughter-in-law (Anita Sokołowska) oppose the journey, so the seniors have no choice but to steal a car. The grandparents' crazy plan is supported by their granddaughter (Julia Wieniawa) and a spiteful neighbor (Wiktor Zborowski). Finally, Józek and Elżbieta travel on their own terms: they laugh, take risks, and love as if they were 20 years old. When the characters reach their destination, they will understand that the place in the world they occupy is the right one.
