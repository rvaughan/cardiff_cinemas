\nMediCinema builds and runs cinemas inside hospitals, that reduce patient anxiety, stress and loneliness and support patients at times when it’s hard to cope.\nMediCinemas screen all the latest films free of charge for patients, and are specially designed to accommodate beds, wheelchairs and medical equipment and staffed with nurses and volunteers. Four misfits — Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Jack Black).","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/AMINECRAFTMOVIE%3AMEDICINEMACHARITYSCREENING.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=DXIKtyTHj67RPk%2F5vfSi4XuCKQJ0HLktTjnY1Hv1%2F%2FBwZQSBaGCEdkRZAravF4zYETsXBpvYGcwic1t0B8tWTnRmbPPVqY%2B76NlYNXk8khwYbcXdr7YA%2BBuFULrzNjIj%2FHtnN49o9D41ROmDci1jQ6B5AjOqFBN0NVdWS1f90kTzVDZ9OPP2SyXeglpmMdu%2Fh%2BkPEheXFsUnNzerWy1na9Tbw%2BvKFgiAH%2BGKAG2tIfpiXsZGt94wO1KH3J5my5a71Nl5M1w%2FQLnb5duq3%2FnG9r1xzLsZo8ZC1B5E%2BI9udrDKNSRPfDsrjb%2FlRrxFy%2F4xe7UL6APt%2F4DlhYglgcYDiA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 03 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-03T18:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-76770"}]}],"length_in_minutes":101},{"title":"A REAL PAIN","description":"Mismatched cousins David and Benji reunite for a tour through Poland to honor their beloved grandmother.

Mikey Madison stuns in the title role, delivering a career-defining performance in this bold and unforgettable story.\n\nIn Sean Baker’s latest dramedy, Anora, the sharp-witted Anora (Mikey Madison), an Uzbek-American sex worker from Brooklyn, gets her shot at a Cinderella story when she impulsively marries Vanya (Mark Eidelstein), the son of a Russian oligarch. What begins as an unlikely whirlwind romance quickly turns into a battle of wills, as Vanya's parents rush to New York, determined to annul the marriage and protect their family’s wealth and reputation.\n\nTrue to Baker’s signature style, Anora blends biting humour with raw emotion as Anora’s life teeters between comedic chaos and heart-wrenching

His primary target is Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), a rebellious vampire who seeks to unleash an ancient blood god and rule over both vampires and humans.

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH

masterful adaptation, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats.\n\nBased on the 2016 novel by Robert Harris, Conclave is a 2024 mystery thriller directed by Edward Berger, and tells the story of one of the world’s most secretive and ancient events – selecting the new Pope.\n\nAfter the unexpected death of the Pope, Cardinal-Dean Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) is forced to put aside any grief and is tasked with putting together a conclave and running the covert process of selecting a new Pope. Cardinal Lawrence (Fiennes) gathers the Catholic Church’s most powerful leaders from around the world, including the US candidate Bellini (Stanley Tucci), Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto), a more traditional Italian. A more powerful American, Tremblay (John Lithgow), the increasingly popular Nigerian Adeyemi (Lucian Msamati) and the mysterious contender Benitez (Carlos Diehz), who has been working in Kabul. \n\nHowever, once they are all locked together in the halls of the Vatican, Lawrence (Fiennes) uncovers a trail of deep secrets which could shake the foundations of the Roman Catholic Church. Conclave stars Ralph Fiennes, Isabella Rossellini, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, and Sergio Castellitto.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/CONCLAVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=jVHxzlP8a7Uyh%2F7e%2FfRWTP4GyTd7Xd%2BQdhsDpgSjk%2B%2BxUZ2hHCWTmJM4Dt7ZJHabnAbKZU0FyvullH7rSiMrkEoXT4tZdVNfSpyxdNAwqaoNRyAEiV3XEQAatzI0LFTI48m%2FJuY1yuGIP5FNYLNv3PgoGGangjHA8Myesx4dUavPW3o4E4cDgNt7BXLf3vsa%2FSrae%2FV5SkveWPfAZGaUZKzwCwfxp7vY2FK%2BSGZbAoWrGiNVDqpMAVI9cr2PhQuJMkSYoG5SG3DkOSd4NSIhs%2FX7eBysPaP3IfbNaEUJEy1KIe4T64hEZj%2BjiXK5R99uWS8WAeiNSmCB54LjbG43lQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-21T10:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39828"},{"time":"2025-03-21T12:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77057"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-22T10:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39863"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 23 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-23T18:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39887"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"MON 24 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-24T13:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77067"},{"time":"2025-03-24T15:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39907"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 25 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-25T14:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39922"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 26 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-26T12:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77169"},{"time":"2025-03-26T16:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39944"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 27 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-27T10:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39984"},{"time":"2025-03-27T15:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39974"}]}],"length_in_minutes":120},{"title":"COURT - STATE VS.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation,

This isn’t your average ‘rom-com’…Set in the irreverent and profane world of cult classic The Football Factory, MARCHING POWDER is a hilarious, poignant and action-packed big screen drama that follows the story of Jack (Danny Dyer), an aging, drug-taking football hooligan who feels increasingly irrelevant in today’s society as he struggles to keep his family together. Hooked on drugs and adrenaline; and struggling to resist the pull of his gang of fellow football fans, Jack is arrested after some violent matchday exploits and given six weeks to turn his life around, or else face a long spell in prison. Juggling his marriage, his mates, his hard-nut bully of a father-in-law and his wayward 25-year-old stepbrother, Jack tries to get his life back on-track but slowly his world starts to spiral out of control. There’s romance, there’s comedy, but this ain’t no ‘rom-com’…this is real life, on the line.","rating":"18","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/MARCHINGPOWDER.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=PUz4e6XA55ZO76Pqi9oLjpeWnjIFwhmrt4Vwm9TCKpCP%2FItdBqrdU%2B7UElLBme1M%2Bt8Y%2FftNrl8LUMy%2FsjJ%2FsuaULEMcib5SK15RnM1zEWL2L%2Fu4mWsdlzBgLFg4j3HXTVGqbUV06hL%2FqaEAz%2B6b5PuPPFMZEwgpgz0wENoqKFll77Ib8s94kr08NXa5Hp%2FWJdubuONCJil%2FxvYc6Bgbbbc7ZVve%2BoyYGCCWelFC0hNn4MMAtnPt4ajIxuq2wV1Tm5JtwafWy2m0oxB4DJi6u86AQdT%2FoPglo6KnQya%2F68yBnnUoo%2FhYMUCZaqbXmJEHG88H94%2FsoAcuK9DfA01UNg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-21T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld

Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/MEDICINEMA%3AAMINECRAFTMOVIE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ht8UOQ54sqjzCsuahdQkF4lfouQ8UW78guUn9l7oGVqthqGx4521qjqFm4EyoEgHxEW57II%2F3tOGYLXtCet8l%2Bk3Unxm%2BIlr4J63usSEJqicHlEFMwtjf%2FtBbgnen9WpMmB9Z3ifB1k1xYHcQnfxfq3U4zEZI9R193ptLSkkVx76ma5asRTlAHjBmVPtczUavQP3zx7c%2FhYul77RkFIDX9QI1k9mN1mDVl3ExiwZTN3VNmOphXvZdr%2Fn3YA1oXUBXKrwkY6T8xt0jUbbaOP0SZ%2B7zj0cloZa5dV21kmQtXPv3%2B3fvN1tl7TnvufxFXF2FvmF4ZpVawCb9nukxIz7rQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 03 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-03T18:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/149462"}]}],"length_in_minutes":101},{"title":"MICKEY 17","description":"From the Academy Award-winning writer/director of “Parasite,” Bong Joon Ho, comes his next groundbreaking cinematic experience, “Mickey 17.” The unlikely hero, Mickey Barnes (Robert Pattinson) has found himself in the extraordinary circumstance of working for an employer who demands the ultimate commitment to the job… to die, for a living. \n\nWritten and directed by Bong Joon Ho, “Mickey 17” stars Robert Pattinson (“The Batman,” “Tenet”), Naomi Ackie (“Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker”), Steven Yeun (“Nope”), with Academy Award nominees Toni Collette (“Hereditary”), and Mark Ruffalo (“Poor Things”). \n\nThe film is produced by Dede Gardner (Oscar winner for “Moonlight,” “12 Years a Slave”), Jeremy Kleiner (Oscar winner for “Moonlight,” “12 Years a Slave”), Bong Joon Ho and Dooho Choi (“Okja,” “Snowpiercer”).

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 09 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-09T18:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77258"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 10 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-10T18:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77259"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 11 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-11T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292054&lang=en-GB"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 12 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-12T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292055&lang=en-GB"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 13 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-13T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292056&lang=en-GB"}]}],"length_in_minutes":104},{"title":"OPUS","description":"A young writer (Ayo Edebiri) is invited to the remote compound of a legendary pop star (John Malkovich) who mysteriously disappeared thirty years ago.

Set in the hauntingly beautiful ruins of the ancient Roman Amphitheater in Pompeii, Italy, the film captures Pink Floyd performing an intimate concert without an audience.\n\nFilmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience.\n\nAdditionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. This meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos.\n\nThese upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release. Inspired by the golden warmth of Pompeii’s iconic setting, the remaster transforms this timeless piece into a masterpiece of sight and sound.\n\nExperience Pink Floyd like never before through this pioneering audio-visual remaster!","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/PINKFLOYDATPOMPEII%E2%80%93MCMLXXII.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=cn%2FXnpyEf0h6ZN2SgdEYBrKAte2CNNc8SIjAWbEnvZFp03PtpdpFnu3p41hTHoojl%2Fv%2BilKa8VOElhwBH0XKjwhcSDhKr2daQmquZjCEeAM24rMqeKcWTAvNWaWlFjkDRxBPgaqEYnrwHLfPadI990L3hXaSFjKZJEKDzrdPrdgGFx%2B034%2BIDBxtKQEWtBmIfEG8lxQ5Ef2cAf0kDumtjWaA0fEVWajXWvJmeET6Y3%2F95mQTS1tKlwumwOaE69TzO2i26zuyoZzidBHot7UcmzToLNGDFdsD8XzM3B7ARiiZCA%2FuxAJSytZ8UOUsbIevHZAKc%2BFwWgzCtchjqcchuw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 24 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-24T18:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148472"},{"time":"2025-04-24T19:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39477"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 27 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-27T12:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148473"},{"time":"2025-04-27T15:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39479"}]}],"length_in_minutes":90},{"title":"PREDATOR","description":"Deep in the jungle, several bodies have been discovered skinned and hanging from trees, although who or what could have done this is a mystery.

Fresh from their arranged marriage, Uma moves into her husband’s cramped one-room home in Mumbai. It is an awkward start; she’s not the domestic wife he might have hoped for, while he is meek and more interested in boozing than engaging with her. Disillusioned with her new life, Uma finds independence by venturing out into the city. \n\nHowever, she starts to experience symptoms of a mysterious feral illness that she cannot shake off. Kandhari’s vibrant and ornate symmetrical compositions have attracted comparisons to Wes Anderson, yet Sister Midnight is cool original. It operates on its own frequency, thrillingly rebelling against convention, much like its heroine Uma – portrayed by the terrific Radhika Apte, who combines charm with a gift for physical comedy.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SISTERMIDNIGHT.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=gKDbnx%2Bv80w5vSwXoLeIecsuor1oKrs2mTLp4AKEOGyUJoLI9FlCU1OrLergJYxRHCJK8xqACArzbnuaAo5oTJaoK8SsNDfAUv4X8bhwXnWPvZEgQJ%2FcySTQU%2B5JlI10DM26WXR4nSBpzGTeO3tKH4Cz3crd2lP9%2ButG1YEEWGgs1q58Eg9pU%2Bdaws6%2B13Hp6BOwXvK4ns3MCzL25grryHglDa5QjuuDP%2BxWluuat8Lwxvinek7Bc2z1zRvTYp1HgWOtAdvSeKADNfoPeWAh0VKWWREL31kcB6cKjM58LGrgCO7T3KnETeSyJZSpf9qt%2FHO2vYheK%2B8DxWIVVQhGMQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 31 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-31T11:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39865"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 02 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-02T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39866"}]}],"length_in_minutes":107},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n Watched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione

However, the resistance also sends a reprogrammed T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the same model that once tried to kill Sarah, to protect him.\n\nAs they flee the relentless T-1000, Sarah, John, and the T-800 form an unlikely bond. Determined to prevent Judgement Day—the nuclear apocalypse that will lead to humanity’s downfall—they set out to destroy Skynet’s creator before it’s too late.\n\nScreening as a part of our Late Nights season.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGMyMGNkMDUtMjc2Ni00NWFlLTgyODEtZTY2MzBiZTg0OWZiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 28 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-28T21:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39473"}]}],"length_in_minutes":137},{"title":"TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY","description":"A cyborg, identical to the one who failed to kill Sarah Connor, must now protect her teenage son, John Connor, from a more advanced and powerful cyborg.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/TERMINATOR2%3AJUDGEMENTDAY.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ddyyLTSZfLEznG0ApKdaqvBc6N5J4d78qjDqUJy2Snv7y8yn%2BYZ1XMyh04RsJsvAeW8eIqNZhzyZw7tUQM2BjiY3GbwN4slalfGXb1mkP5EfoTKwa2Icm0SccgPGlw0u2A6SBGjRHbNw%2BW0%2FbKTIvQ1qCagymOymkagDFfTznb%2FXhmoq3EMVULTpXAyoT3mm0vALDQ9MAlnvJOPS89k5uIIj7gI0klc7qwsbRzA%2F1kDTQOB5Q219RgB8Hvz%2FmygGwLncWju8LaBb3Cj024%2BaUXQO3N%2B8hZzLYikzSPbISohpmihe2b1959BSjGe72KCtpVCkruP3yR6pguoqzNpeiw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 02 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-02T18:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020125/285919","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":137},{"title":"THE ALTO KNIGHTS","description":"Directed by Barry Levinson and starring Robert De Niro .

Odysseus has also changed—scarred by his experience of the Trojan war, he is no longer the mighty warrior from years past— but he must rediscover his strength in order to win back all that he has lost.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THERETURN.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=nIftRIGLglbCCDV2QGhmIrV3OaBmucNKcpGy3Iqm0%2FDniN1h%2BZnLMs5FZefAeGfpkgGQ%2F8KQ%2Fn8u3QYv%2BYj1VrgpLW%2BlyWvF4AnzCjL49FDbEguK4rrG3l%2F40vgCBY%2FOtkzgdpQhvJDTK4mPanOzeIwS5yrVHzLt9lfAEM9q0h9jJae9Nc%2FBiCD64lGIt0utyQd4LdJnRtmK62Q%2BDPYH6k0j1da%2BgYbDsSmDXIS9RHZ02aw98JPMmAbXoWYgee8I%2FEDUqAQiZQ%2FiI%2FlclogBWt9chJuFYTZ9w6OaYnwubec8nc9WXWZx5qt64Lh0OasPW%2F6VwIdK3CuhIfh8f%2Bk8Ww%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 09 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-09T17:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/149457"}]}],"length_in_minutes":0},{"title":"THE RETURN - LIVE WITH RALPH FIENNES","description":"Join us for a special preview of The Return on 9 April, followed by a discussion, broadcast live from the British Museum, with Academy Award nominee Ralph Fiennes, director Uberto Pasolini, British Museum's Keeper of Greece and Rome, Tom Harrison and Curator: Reception of the Ancient Mediterranean, Vicky Donnellan.\r\n\r\nThere will be no adverts or trailers for this screening.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THERETURN-LIVEWITHRALPHFIENNES.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=rsVtIZUjUJvrHNC09wjKnwv3ftiJlvjXU5tkCOtYxsrS0IBVQC%2BoBUPkxBmCt8N9xZOb7wRVpJO06%2FvQ4JpPeCrQ6xFAqNhPHT99leaCaa%2F9J5cN8nXDhdnqZvUQbFvkAVDek79sWKlAEmj5o5Q3axPQ%2FFhScKTeDGJ8cLuzYnjQkatoOeFNMJQb8M4iIgMgydCDhkSLGBJq4fXIUZ1siZ2GgT%2BZN6GBMmRpSH1XIRN7QdiqRZa0XAp7PB8ZJRZRFzr%2BY%2BM0deuRxjTqmxqy8%2BmOP936184KeDmRsjIUPPCH0vIWAC3Fi82qAvA9AEXH6A%2FjAvoxOpSkSasO%2FoanfA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 09 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-09T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-76926"}]}],"length_in_minutes":161},{"title":"THE ROCK","description":"A mild-mannered chemist and an ex-con must lead the counterstrike when a rogue group of military men, led by a renegade general, threaten a nerve gas attack from Alcatraz","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEROCK.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=NjLtNf92l55j%2BEaIe2pTvzqXSya%2FNPAZPxK56wf1eqef3IBN5zeZk5T8VoFZdwX9gmhzR8Ckab4ohFz9VrtMFhTkoODDGPMQfTim0BWgpiR3WPG9hqfCEeFOzv0OQYShW%2BFV%2BgIyU9cKkv5C6VKiUtOceeyt9EvkiW4uZZK1iYyjtg8A8iPHSXh5J9nTtt6cJCTkxl269lHN%2BQSo%2FFTVXFjXXNU7R98Cjc4BnGo6k6FECnmpsv4JDGnckTrezCfgp4%2B2oZltffXy128z9JrV91fAoVfI8lcPaLqnfifCQ0HiTjlz%2FvJtqWo%2B6CKYkcOVEo8Xsm7vgJHypfThXEuwVw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 29 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-29T20:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020133/285916","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"MON 31 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-31T17:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020133/285062","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":136},{"title":"THE ROYAL BALLET: BALLET TO BROADWAY: WHEELDON WORKS","description":"Sensuous contemporary ballet meets the energy of musical theatre in four distinctive short works.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 23 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-23T09:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-76976"},{"time":"2025-03-23T11:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292173&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-23T11:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-76982"},{"time":"2025-03-23T13:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292174&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-23T14:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-76977"},{"time":"2025-03-23T15:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292175&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-23T16:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-76298"},{"time":"2025-03-23T18:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292176&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-23T18:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-76299"}]}]},{"title":"HANS ZIMMER & FRIENDS: DIAMOND IN THE DESERT","description":"Hans Zimmer & Friends: Diamond in the Desert captures an extraordinary live performance of some of Zimmer's most revered compositions, including music from Dune, Gladiator, Interstellar, The Lion King, and much more.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 24 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-24T13:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77075"},{"time":"2025-03-24T13:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292177&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-24T15:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292178&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-24T16:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77085"},{"time":"2025-03-24T18:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292179&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-24T18:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77091"}]}]},{"title":"I'M STILL HERE","description":"BRAZIL, 1971.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird.

However, when a series of bizarre accidents begin to happen, Nicholas starts to suspect something more sinister is at play. As he investigates further, he uncovers a conspiracy involving the town's seemingly perfect community and a deadly secret.\n\nScreening on Sundays and Tuesdays as part of our Throwback Season where we revisit classics.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 26 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-26T13:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292279&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-26T13:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77141"},{"time":"2025-03-26T15:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292280&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-26T16:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77151"},{"time":"2025-03-26T18:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292281&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-26T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77165"}]}]},{"title":"HANS ZIMMER & FRIENDS: DIAMOND IN THE DESERT","description":"Hans Zimmer & Friends: Diamond in the Desert captures an extraordinary live performance of some of Zimmer's most revered compositions, including music from Dune, Gladiator, Interstellar, The Lion King, and much more.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.

Disillusioned with her new life, Uma finds independence by venturing out into the city. \n\nHowever, she starts to experience symptoms of a mysterious feral illness that she cannot shake off. Kandhari’s vibrant and ornate symmetrical compositions have attracted comparisons to Wes Anderson, yet Sister Midnight is cool original. It operates on its own frequency, thrillingly rebelling against convention, much like its heroine Uma – portrayed by the terrific Radhika Apte, who combines charm with a gift for physical comedy.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SISTERMIDNIGHT.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=gKDbnx%2Bv80w5vSwXoLeIecsuor1oKrs2mTLp4AKEOGyUJoLI9FlCU1OrLergJYxRHCJK8xqACArzbnuaAo5oTJaoK8SsNDfAUv4X8bhwXnWPvZEgQJ%2FcySTQU%2B5JlI10DM26WXR4nSBpzGTeO3tKH4Cz3crd2lP9%2ButG1YEEWGgs1q58Eg9pU%2Bdaws6%2B13Hp6BOwXvK4ns3MCzL25grryHglDa5QjuuDP%2BxWluuat8Lwxvinek7Bc2z1zRvTYp1HgWOtAdvSeKADNfoPeWAh0VKWWREL31kcB6cKjM58LGrgCO7T3KnETeSyJZSpf9qt%2FHO2vYheK%2B8DxWIVVQhGMQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":107,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 31 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-31T11:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39865"}]}]},{"title":"THE LAST SHOWGIRL","description":"When the glittering Las Vegas revue she has headlined for decades announces it will soon close, glamorous showgirl Shelly (Pamela Anderson) must reconcile with the decisions she’s made and the life she has built as she plans her next act whilst also striving to repair the relationship with her daughter (Billie Lourd).

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 06 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-06T10:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290873&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-06T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290115&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-06T13:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74778"},{"time":"2025-04-06T15:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290395&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-06T15:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75100"},{"time":"2025-04-06T18:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290870&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-06T18:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74777"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 06 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-06T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147665"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-06T12:45:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147384"},{"time":"2025-04-06T13:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020097/284596","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-06T15:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147385"},{"time":"2025-04-06T16:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39109"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-06T17:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147386"},{"time":"2025-04-06T17:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020097/284598","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"time":"2025-04-06T18:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39176"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-06T19:35:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147666"}]}]},{"title":"THE ROYAL OPERA: TURANDOT","description":"Puccini’s captivating opera of a cold-hearted princess and her mysterious suitor.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":100,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 09 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-09T18:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77258"}]}]},{"title":"SANTOSH","description":"A government scheme sees newly widowed Santosh inherit her husband’s job as a police constable in the rural badlands of Northern India.

The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":104,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 12 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-12T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292055&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":104,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 13 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-13T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292056&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 14 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-14T13:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39873"},{"time":"2025-04-14T18:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-76300"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 16 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-16T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39874"}]}]},{"title":"HEY DUGGEE AT THE MOVIES","description":"Join Duggee and his friends for 8 special episodes back to back on the big screen!

The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 17 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-17T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291272&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-17T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291273&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 17 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-17T13:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148491"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-17T15:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148492"}]}]}]},{"tab_date_label":"FRI 18 APR","film_data":[{"title":"BING AND HIS FRIENDS AT THE CINEMA","description":"Come and join Bing and His Friends at the cinema!

A heavily muscled construction worker, he boasts a beautiful wife, Lori, good friends, and a technologically advanced home featuring video phones and even video walls. But he is haunted by dreams of a mysterious brunette woman and the red wastelands of Mars. Quaid visits Rekall, a unique travel agency that implants the memory of an adventure into its customers' minds, to get the chance to live out his Martian fantasies. When something goes terribly wrong and a blocked off portion of his mind is activated, Quaid finds himself at the center of a dangerous conspiracy. He must travel to Mars and get to the bottom of why he is being hunted by henchmen. But how can he know that what he's experiencing isn't just part of the Rekall experience? Are the mutant revolutionaries on Mars his allies, enemies, or complete fabrications? And is the lovely brunette at his side nothing more than a figment of his imagination?","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/TOTALRECALL.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=arA4k8WJe1kuaUiWMIFJKLi1kwVF0iylrRWHC4lx0loIgwDMg%2BJAPMML6rNedd01xAln9cvrrCyhNuSia8xE6zM7BP4l%2Bwxk1r8ek7%2BdHnCoDWlwtTOhFQfsnL03C1YRd2eoC1Ew3DCids2Ab12pOlsnIdeCOp7N%2FRXx7AhDO8iBz62yWIYSP4Q8OmZBkjyUHOx9oHE7kQcgA6giIWZXR4fesMA8TCjxp4RwH%2BrZC3AQm5MC7sLZDg1k54Vpp3uI7NSO7ustNSGoOsxYE2jtfG3Z80QJj3%2FdJEnCiBueCzV%2FRwMDccsDP3fgtCB8%2FQqSRW844J%2BUBgTxE59yTW6s8g%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":113,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 18 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-18T21:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147661"}]}]},{"title":"WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT","description":"Wallace and his loyal dog, Gromit, set out to discover the mystery behind the garden sabotage that plagues their village and threatens the annual giant vegetable growing","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/WALLACE%26GROMIT%3ATHECURSEOFTHEWERE-RABBIT.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=xzpA4S1BWTqogzbZWsSstWLIedwBddi1a7ihdejWdHdF2LQG34mXxjCAw95kXW%2FzqGUcCIwnE2sQmgQNX1GvkakbquZcMzegpxwRhNiOXph22SDchiZo1pDRifX1LnfwV0RtZ1qLTywBMW%2BS3EEqMDwwE%2B%2FyS9bpnvXwfIueriEWmcQ9mu8SuKGqsf3AdmS1QfUi6u%2F65IFxnnkvkyWaqe%2F5EL7Xae%2BnDDnsrulqDKsCp7cm1GsmC7JO2PgYZPShA8hYcMDUIMTs9v7P8uReUB2FpBfM6BRirnDje6fBkTrBuuvCghwFQfXLz6V%2BGJlNwTNq7oaOGGx%2BTnmkzOkhRw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 18 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-18T11:45:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020206/285706","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}]}]},{"tab_date_label":"SAT 19 APR","film_data":[{"title":"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST","description":"An arrogant nobleman is turned into a beast and, in order to break the spell, he tries to win the love of a village girl.\n\n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BEAUTYANDTHEBEAST.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ohL0EA2VJXBoaKtjU%2B6rmTXd%2BjBnE0v4kHoDfrXRuwvIfQFtvtXSbb2MqTxO9dr8X6jm0TEXHV3rwh80WmWyiazrPLsINk7rYHVcOR49ORd4AvmfZTdbavgirS4SjPDHA5f49rvblffZ7HqQxfgPpAZgcQhJuotPeh4Hpdj%2FcOjFY9G1NyzlRqrmsxcCbRg5elvnsudJojF2nTm9VarqY5gPmb656y1FnX4V9bq7FpwoYPmI0UjNV2mNNkDxKXi7hLSp9v5rPUN2mSQIBLgZnvUq9fl4ViJuaL%2Bo5hxw%2BVZeypPJvwKraPZmg0uj33eynMbemAmUK3f3EML4BPGrUQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":87,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 19 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-19T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146619"}]}]},{"title":"BING AND HIS FRIENDS AT THE CINEMA","description":"Come and join Bing and His Friends at the cinema!
