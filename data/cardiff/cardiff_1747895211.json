Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/EXHIBITIONONSCREENMICHELANGELOLOVEANDDEATH.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=RIKC4YjofCvL%2BTPjAl5V1DrWDT%2FujgKz2KlsvRhMkklwprbq4Kc9K0DhxFUn1B5fs9ZHr4ZLG2x0iqn%2Fv2W4yV4FuGf2%2BFIC6kREd%2FjIdum1FKxadwVX10VUdtUelZYxh1jfgmZBoYOmedNlMJQq197mYBQvIvWvy8J40T4CRoGsyNvo4hn%2FGWtSCfuDC7htD8A1w5Qgm0tNGqpj%2BUUC%2B5Txi42joHjLY%2FMz6WHUABBMtKM1jPxI%2FLKKtNq7hvJ7jt3lC7wDCq7l8NiGPDLeNmrvpv4ZZ55Wn4LlmWf5XBsGDJ8QPYzMASCfaDfeMSyn9aHxDhNNu%2F8PqmPxJDViMA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37639"}]}],"length_in_minutes":91},{"title":"F1 THE MOVIE","description":"Dubbed “the greatest that never was,” Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) was FORMULA 1’s most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career.

biblical proportions washes its home away, a solitary cat must seek refuge with a motley crew of animals, who gradually learn to get along in this endearing, Oscar-winning animation.\n\nWunderkind director Gints Zilbalodis has taken the animation world by storm with his beautifully crafted sophomore feature Flow, which has received a multitude of awards and nominations to date, including two nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards.  \n\nThe mystical world he creates in Flow is in peril. There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.

first-ever Lithuanian culinary comedy, TASTY, is a hilarious story about two friends and their adventure on a high-end food production reality TV show.\n\nEnthusiastic village girl Saulė (A. Ravdo) and modest single mother Ona (E. Ozarinskaitė) are passionate cooks trapped in the Kaunas canteen \"Tasty\". One day, without Ona's consent, Saulė involves them in a culinary reality show, the main prize of which is their own restaurant. Saulė lies to the jury about her origins and claims that they are both qualified chefs from the restaurant ‚La TASTY‘.\n\nAlthough the TASTY team is initially seen as a joke, their simple but brilliant recipes help them to become the viewers' favourites. Despite their success, tensions between the friends begin to rise as Ona receives more and more attention from the audience and from judge Emanuel (L. Pobedonoscevas). The celebrity chef of the competition, Bruknė (L. Rastokaitė), seizes the opportunity and tries to drive them further apart. Will the friendship between Ona and Saulė stand the

With a race against time they take on an impossible mission to find the Sevastopol and to destroy the highly advanced, and now rouge AI \"\"the Entity\"\", before it ends up the hands of Gabriel (Esai Morales)\n\nAs time is running out and the fate of the world hangs in the balance.

PATH","description":"Join us for an exclusive Times+ preview screening of The Salt Path, a moving adaptation of the best-selling memoir by Raynor Winn.\n\nThe Salt Path is the profound true story of husband and wife, Raynor and Moth Winn’s 630-mile trek along the beautiful but rugged Cornish, Devon and Dorset coastline.\n\nAfter being forcibly removed from their home, they make the desperate decision to walk in the hope that, in nature, they will find solace and a sense of acceptance. With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination. The Salt Path is a journey that is exhilarating, challenging, and liberating in equal measure. A portrayal of home, how it can be lost and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.\n\nEach ticket includes a complimentary popcorn.","rating":"12A","image_link":null,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 29 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-29T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41308"}]}],"length_in_minutes":115},{"title":"UNTIL DAWN","description":"One year after her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers.

As a result she fashions a luxurious new broom with seats on which they can all ride comfortably.\n\nJoin us every Friday or Saturday for toddler-friendly cinema screenings.

Hope dwindling, the group soon realizes they have a limited number of deaths left, and the only way to escape is to survive until dawn.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/UNTILDAWN.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=1vUjlYxuEBPcCY3mk2CFstrTAbmMydoX4aWq8h6PBCq426jjdtIC28GfPYCz%2F9JXES5fYMFqiHC0I8%2FHhLfXbmP6gs%2Fp2gzs4GB8hptNwFis6knyW1TNndPFKxc8aXS2QSDxOLJ686XHLHNzaknKfMKRbqtFq64k0iLyCSxq55ZypzsjxjZYaGQ7mYchkYNC6VXXcLKd4P9vX459sbQ0rPg9L9Tc805l6x5ASZz3PUBXqinlxVCS1xkk6w%2F%2FUj7P4P4gTcPmYM0T%2BDx4KWGdTk8VnbJvVSfVqTrSn5vYCr%2BU%2B9O2NejM9Ivy6IyAXPTcmxQD1Fi6ozwn5EZ1u77sRg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":103,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-23T22:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-81004"}]}]}]},{"tab_date_label":"SAT 24 MAY","film_data":[{"title":"A MINECRAFT MOVIE","description":"Four misfits — Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison, Henry, Natalie and Dawn —find themselves struggling with ordinary problems.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/AMINECRAFTMOVIE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=1dCNYNchU40vC701g1pxfjgagNbR69kfpeGsBzhZNR0DDzY8sMYkpBEjJqp1CjAirxGE2QHLEBklkPzT0xm92OTH907pFulyvBKqbzKZ%2F0pYqslNXAdWi934oK%2FzEi87thhO%2FiXrrQ1mLk%2B3kzAXstvhK8Ap2XBmiqhY54MMgZ882qh3uoJFPivPNgR5Z1ceTvxFCo9GAyv0OSnmszW6vZdWFd3D68Tmz32UI9Wi0WubdX1gy9MtFA2uSP2zUZIXRClwve1w0zNxMZBw86U1oWM28WqvycILVK2K4oYSQ5DW7aBB1CK4Ch%2FnyuoiE0gScZ39tKLYDq1YLqbmELEUNA%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 24 MAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-24T08:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/153625"},{"time":"2025-05-24T08:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80953"},{"time":"2025-05-24T09:15:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00019578/288963","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-24T09:45:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/153573"},{"time":"2025-05-24T10:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=296333&lang=en"},{"time":"2025-05-24T11:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-80952"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-05-24T12:20:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/153574"},{"time":"2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=296334&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET'S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BLUEYATTHECINEMALETSPLAYCHEFCOLLECTION.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=q1hSci0YxpqP0IvGUXRWvJdIuIwZ1EHKJBTEZKoM3v8U93JeB8990Kvtf7etyhAxITRupZPE2p3j1q%2FVmf4k6azXalO%2Bx%2F%2F7ZKXY5QEUviWneTcL64W8YnhkmFQ0A7%2BdlOjRD%2FEl1DzEc7IPpEdNGncwOKQqJXpPPQbpk2Mv6ADyPyXfSureX%2BHUE9kLlxFoeiXefWdvBHrwUbmk80PWDc94i85MKFlxAKvoGzw40NSQleQfU0t3yH%2FvJ7cqOxEWhYOjXBBUeOkPHfPxrYSj9CQjCRyfzs1Xd9Ul5cP%2BtgZtcVDEd6jka4n13BU3NyzZDYdx0aGXnJ7K3Gun7J87MQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":60,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 24 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-24T08:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=296371&lang=en"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET’S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"Bluey at the Cinema: Let’s Play Chef Collection is an hour-long treat for fans of Bluey to enjoy, made up of eight episodes from the TV show’s three series, all based around the fun of food!

its home away, a solitary cat must seek refuge with a motley crew of animals, who gradually learn to get along in this endearing, Oscar-winning animation.\n\nWunderkind director Gints Zilbalodis has taken the animation world by storm with his beautifully crafted sophomore feature Flow, which has received a multitude of awards and nominations to date, including two nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards.  \n\nThe mystical world he creates in Flow is in peril. There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.

But, there, deep in the heart of the green realm, formidable adversaries lurk in the shadows, and before long, the poor, defenceless little mouse crosses paths with a villainous fox, an ominous owl, and a stealthy snake. Of course, all of them cannot wait to gobble him up. Can the brave little mouse put his vibrant imagination to good use to persuade them not to eat him?\n\nRoom on the Broom (2012)\nTo the annoyance of her cat a kindly witch allows a dog, a bird and a frog who have helped her retrieve things she has lost to ride on her broomstick, making it top heavy. The broom is destroyed by a fire-breathing dragon who threatens to eat the witch but the creatures band together to impersonate a monster and save her. As a result she fashions a luxurious new broom with seats on which they can all ride comfortably.\n\nJoin us every Friday or Saturday for toddler-friendly cinema screenings.

seek refuge with a motley crew of animals, who gradually learn to get along in this endearing, Oscar-winning animation.\n\nWunderkind director Gints Zilbalodis has taken the animation world by storm with his beautifully crafted sophomore feature Flow, which has received a multitude of awards and nominations to date, including two nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards.  \n\nThe mystical world he creates in Flow is in peril. There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.

a flood of biblical proportions washes its home away, a solitary cat must seek refuge with a motley crew of animals, who gradually learn to get along in this endearing, Oscar-winning animation.\n\nWunderkind director Gints Zilbalodis has taken the animation world by storm with his beautifully crafted sophomore feature Flow, which has received a multitude of awards and nominations to date, including two nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards.  \n\nThe mystical world he creates in Flow is in peril. There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.

a flood of biblical proportions washes its home away, a solitary cat must seek refuge with a motley crew of animals, who gradually learn to get along in this endearing, Oscar-winning animation.\n\nWunderkind director Gints Zilbalodis has taken the animation world by storm with his beautifully crafted sophomore feature Flow, which has received a multitude of awards and nominations to date, including two nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards.  \n\nThe mystical world he creates in Flow is in peril. There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.

There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.

the beloved blockbuster franchises Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon and The Boss Baby—comes the canine-crime-fighting film adaptation of Dav Pilkey’s New York Times bestselling literary

With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination. The Salt Path is a journey that is exhilarating, challenging, and liberating in equal measure. A portrayal of home, how it can be lost and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.\n\nEach ticket includes a complimentary

One day, without Ona's consent, Saulė involves them in a culinary reality show, the main prize of which is their own restaurant.

Ruben convinces Sonny to come back to FORMULA 1 for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world.
