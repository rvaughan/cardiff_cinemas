show captured recently at the Sadler’s Wells Peacock Theatre is an extraordinary musical journey paying homage to Janis Joplin and her biggest musical influences. \n\nLike a comet that burns far too brightly to last, Janis Joplin exploded onto the music scene in 1967 and, almost overnight, became the queen of rock & roll. The unmistakable voice, filled with raw emotion and tinged with Southern Comfort, made her a must-see headliner from Monterey to Woodstock. \n\nFuelled by such unforgettable songs as “Me and Bobby McGee,” “Piece of My Heart”, “Mercedes Benz”, “Cry Baby” and “Summertime”, a remarkable cast and breakout performances. \n\nA Night with Janis Joplin, written and directed by Randy Johnson, is a musical journey celebrating Janis and her biggest musical influences—icons like Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Odetta, Nina Simone and Bessie Smith, who inspired one of rock ‘n roll’s greatest legends.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ANIGHTWITHJANISJOPLIN%3ATHEMUSICAL.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=QkalYGJp0G9w6i8ezy%2FW77W1gLQ6R5g%2B%2B0VVyoDpZgvMMENTuOkxhLYnumH7FvjEel%2BkK01ajjpL%2BACOmXESQiSnAPnFOU9dLhQN0iLfBfOTURinMPBld5aWqRDOzmqCZn3aFzuFNnSxMu8AI22fCpKiCKiK3QL12Ybd7ex%2FgNqD5YmomSgP%2FQzK%2BXSnlzjm5yCBLimRZ%2BFBP6gQj7RszFM5YmOPnGqxyguKSMJM7qfjI0Q0V%2FGpdDntI3mRv9O6YOUao0tR8tqAZgqAEp%2BTa1nYfzvep%2FLA6YtqbhsImmLjwPtvVcUnIbAhUNZ56WW0i1mlA9eci8QcCIzGcLyNtw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 13 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-13T19:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/142694"},{"time":"2025-03-13T19:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37506"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-13T22:10:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/142695"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 16 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-16T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/142696"}]}],"length_in_minutes":140},{"title":"A REAL PAIN","description":"Mismatched cousins David and Benji reunite for a tour through Poland to honor their beloved grandmother.

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.\n\nWhat led to that first ground-breaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874. See the show that changed everything on the big screen.\n\nMade in close collaboration with the Musee d’Orsay and National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.","rating":null,"image_link":null,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 18 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-18T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37637"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 19 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-19T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37636"}]}],"length_in_minutes":90},{"title":"FINDING NEMO","description":"Life along the Great Barrier Reef is full of dangers when you are a tiny clown fish. And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 22 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-22T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146607"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 23 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-23T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146608"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 01 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-01T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146609"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 02 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-02T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146610"}]}],"length_in_minutes":101},{"title":"FLIGHT RISK","description":"In this high-stakes suspense thriller, Academy Award® nominee Mark Wahlberg (Actor in a Supporting Role, 2006 – The Departed) plays a pilot transporting an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) accompanying a fugitive (Topher Grace) to trial.

Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage.

But when an evil force threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, that same evil has\nreturned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people. However, along her journey, she’ll learn that it’ll take more than a dragon to save the world—it’s going to take trust and teamwork as well. Raya and the Last Dragon\nfeatures the voices of Kelly Marie Tran as Raya, a warrior whose wit is as sharp as her blade, and Awkwafina as the magical, mythical, self-deprecating dragon named Sisu.

Man.\n\nGolden Globe nominee Christopher Abbott (Poor Things, It Comes at Night) stars as Blake, a San Francisco husband and father, who inherits his remote childhood home in rural Oregon after his own father vanishes and is presumed dead. With his marriage to his high-powered wife, Charlotte (Emmy winner Julia Garner; Ozark, Inventing Anna), fraying, Blake persuades Charlotte to take a break from the city and visit the property with their young daughter, Ginger (Matlida Firth; Hullraisers, Coma). But as the family approaches the farmhouse in the dead of night, they’re attacked by an unseen animal and, in a desperate escape, barricade themselves inside the home as the creature prowls the perimeter. As the night stretches on, however, Blake begins to behave strangely, transforming into something unrecognizable, and Charlotte will be forced to decide whether the terror within their house is more lethal than the danger without.\n","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/WOLFMAN.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=UsFS%2BvZnQksXQjsETuOla4OlKlmW2VM2nb4IJNyYAc4oBVEoY7v4uPeUcr4FqvIo0GLHgSJBhND%2FPNkdRTmC3yVUC%2BHxCrKKlGUnEPDDAv%2Fy13mgmGVDGIYKAWfZbgTPyQfaKiL0oqYjXXTBKchxjhzIk%2Fi1kuTUVJVR5N1nT2TJPsdlsiJ%2FjtwDlKKAiy4ubMOyUQzpC%2FuxDiMepP%2BMSeZCoRtbxYjRgm%2FLCof3IQQK7P99rvKaIfiBkw6%2Fwr%2BGKqwCE0pgD28vkzCe5vDuqLabMiAM8bzmqLiPs46i0Brb1XD9ezpOaGhhZhFH0oQx3YYAN7ghAMLF2fT2wFAKiA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase

And if it's a journey, then only in their favorite car from their youth. This opportunity arises, because the perfect Nysa appears in the son's (Mariusz Drężek) second-hand shop. However, the son and daughter-in-law (Anita Sokołowska) oppose the journey, so the seniors have no choice but to steal a car. The grandparents' crazy plan is supported by their granddaughter (Julia Wieniawa) and a spiteful neighbor (Wiktor Zborowski). Finally, Józek and Elżbieta travel on their own terms: they laugh, take risks, and love as if they were 20 years old.

As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SEPTEMBER5.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KFQZzUFDcIkH%2BTtxrG%2BABQL3jIUSu2hZ47GeU6Nju2HAVE%2FWmlLs8mKzzBqwxmI2FCdDGrn1hhJSiv%2FEz1RKNFN2irq4WdxMhoHzmXEOJhNgaQzlumEYlW2bNzmNhccTSD1At%2FbBNjYfZiGlJ%2FcdHaA2%2Fy3PcLwcR1UlDOJVpqNLy%2FEm9bJw1FryW8DkghfWZ3zfSK8LLbVmLe%2B4%2BRosKPzgNIsPHTT4AmeI%2Bz8OabWo6xfFsVZ%2F0GBeBr3IbeajV4k4ODsCup2dpNTcFq4SAYG0flXiKIW2lRvwczzKca0bt9wnypV7PToGDzz%2BwzOYPws%2Bh63pldMJVyWZiSjFvw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 03 FEB","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-03T19:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=288415&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-03T20:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/38611"}]}]},{"title":"ZODIAC","description":"A 2025 re-release of the 2007 film Zodiac","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ZODIAC.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=bjOHGa%2BHTeKuzU9hzA1Sb%2BezTq5TZiWkIh%2BfCLvRS27g5CCizRx7YHMlQanPdzNP7cDXr0de4LumQsrR67R2MfVguyWzyrj7ajThHqNuh89dmTJJgSUeBxj31JNZfMmBQVX8wjRGPOyq8K3kE2Yv50Ll8e%2B9S71ChwLnbi9pd9tWe0S8jJlClZTkQ8HsZLSF0bzBQucIrEaExluZyqLf%2BY17ERe9ulMYRVk1sIeM6RbJpIx%2B3QTVOLV7uor8ctYH79Z9NimmJgObRxHZVyLYUnO8b1QVWDjYAWKkPnIlvd9rNj7Y2yZpKyzr2scqaNSs0VDJfmSD9Uq5V6UJ4dWE4A%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":0,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 03 FEB","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-03T19:40:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020012/283872","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}]}]},{"tab_date_label":"TUE 04 FEB","film_data":[{"title":"COMPANION","description":"Hey you.

Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SEPTEMBER5.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KFQZzUFDcIkH%2BTtxrG%2BABQL3jIUSu2hZ47GeU6Nju2HAVE%2FWmlLs8mKzzBqwxmI2FCdDGrn1hhJSiv%2FEz1RKNFN2irq4WdxMhoHzmXEOJhNgaQzlumEYlW2bNzmNhccTSD1At%2FbBNjYfZiGlJ%2FcdHaA2%2Fy3PcLwcR1UlDOJVpqNLy%2FEm9bJw1FryW8DkghfWZ3zfSK8LLbVmLe%2B4%2BRosKPzgNIsPHTT4AmeI%2Bz8OabWo6xfFsVZ%2F0GBeBr3IbeajV4k4ODsCup2dpNTcFq4SAYG0flXiKIW2lRvwczzKca0bt9wnypV7PToGDzz%2BwzOYPws%2Bh63pldMJVyWZiSjFvw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 07 FEB","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-07T15:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-73105"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-07T16:40:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146571"},{"time":"2025-02-07T17:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-73106"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-07T19:05:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146574"},{"time":"2025-02-07T20:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-73107"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-07T21:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146570"}]}]},{"title":"THOMAS & FRIENDS: THE ADVENTURE BEGINS","description":"Let your little ones experience the magic of cinema with our mini-movies. \n\nAll aboard for Thomas' very first adventure!

Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage.

Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral

And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 22 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-22T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146607"}]}]},{"title":"THE MONKEY","description":"A new trip from the director of Longlegs, Osgood Perkins.

And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 23 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-23T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146608"}]}]},{"title":"NT LIVE: THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST","description":"Three-time Olivier Award-winner Sharon D Clarke is joined by Ncuti Gatwa (Doctor Who; Sex Education) in this joyful reimagining of Oscar Wilde’s most celebrated comedy.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/NTLIVE%3ATHEIMPORTANCEOFBEINGEARNEST.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ZHkFl3gjVKy5%2BngwaSBDUbyzFKqzssimtbxdcZmMfER1P%2FOAhpAvvMNe%2BybvLBSew%2F09OV%2BlMEahUBuxMe2x78t4i9F7SnZ0mxcEkBIZo1KOOeuoKOAWhO7XJeQfIdc6w0tNvm66nhZvR4%2F7ptUTlwKc2R8lwyQcLfa2WimiQjaYGoVGVILv%2BxSUdWCNRwih5K625eYYZcZoIT3ixtADTVGX9Y67HLwcjPNRwHnDYx3g2WzG%2F3g6L8KiXJFx7zaDhOIAQeuGQi8uzhewXoeVjlzneETA%2FCJgMCMx2ISVhUYLVUPD7BPdzK0%2B7vUfXqRfxn33pVNEXth%2BTfcmnyeh2Q%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":170,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 23 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-23T13:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/137645"},{"time":"2025-02-23T14:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=281074&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-23T14:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-73119"}]}]},{"title":"THE MONKEY","description":"A new trip from the director of Longlegs, Osgood Perkins.

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.\n\nWhat led to that first ground-breaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874.
