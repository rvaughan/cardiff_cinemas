Like a comet that burns far too brightly to last, Janis Joplin exploded onto the music scene in 1967 and, almost overnight, became the queen of rock & roll. The unmistakable voice, filled with raw emotion and tinged with Southern Comfort, made her a must-see headliner from Monterey to Woodstock. Fuelled by such unforgettable songs as “Me and Bobby McGee,” “Piece of My Heart”, “Mercedes Benz”, “Cry Baby” and “Summertime”, a remarkable cast and breakout performances. A Night with Janis Joplin, written and directed by Randy Johnson, is a musical journey celebrating Janis and her biggest musical influences—icons like Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Odetta, Nina Simone and Bessie Smith, who inspired one of rock ‘n roll’s greatest legends.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ANIGHTWITHJANISJOPLIN%3ATHEMUSICAL.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=QkalYGJp0G9w6i8ezy%2FW77W1gLQ6R5g%2B%2B0VVyoDpZgvMMENTuOkxhLYnumH7FvjEel%2BkK01ajjpL%2BACOmXESQiSnAPnFOU9dLhQN0iLfBfOTURinMPBld5aWqRDOzmqCZn3aFzuFNnSxMu8AI22fCpKiCKiK3QL12Ybd7ex%2FgNqD5YmomSgP%2FQzK%2BXSnlzjm5yCBLimRZ%2BFBP6gQj7RszFM5YmOPnGqxyguKSMJM7qfjI0Q0V%2FGpdDntI3mRv9O6YOUao0tR8tqAZgqAEp%2BTa1nYfzvep%2FLA6YtqbhsImmLjwPtvVcUnIbAhUNZ56WW0i1mlA9eci8QcCIzGcLyNtw%3D%3D","screenings":[{"date":"THU 13 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-13T19:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/142694"},{"time":"2025-03-13T19:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37506"}]},{"date":"SUN 16 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-16T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/142696"}]}],"lengthInMinutes":140},{"title":"A REAL PAIN","description":"Mismatched cousins David (Jesse Eisenberg) and Benji (Kieran Culkin) reunite for a tour through Poland to honor their beloved grandmother.

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.\n\nWhat led to that first ground-breaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874. See the show that changed everything on the big screen.\n\nMade in close collaboration with the Musee d’Orsay and National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.","rating":null,"image_link":null,"screenings":[{"date":"TUE 18 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-18T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37637"}]},{"date":"WED 19 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-19T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37636"}]}],"lengthInMinutes":90},{"title":"FROZEN","description":"Fearless optimist Anna sets off on an epic journey-teaming up with rugged mountain man Kristoff and his loyal reindeer Sven-to find her sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter.

When one of the swans turns into a beautiful woman, Odette, he is enraptured. But she is under a spell that holds her captive, allowing her to regain her human form only at night.\n\nVon Rothbart, arbiter of Odette's curse, tricks the Prince into declaring his love for the identical Odile and thus breaking his vow to Odette. Doomed to remain a swan forever, Odette has but one way to break the sorcerer's spell.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEROYALBALLET%3ASWANLAKE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ouV5LO%2BpEszgTDhkEAUEDHBT%2Baw59bDFv%2B17WzOWyVFWm9J4U1W790%2BbeT7tea4MyFotacMcQyqKOxwVfPvN9u3TRwteZ5MDEuMVXPMm9G1t03ie8eYrlsl%2FgfeEh1y7%2BKe7LfBXaIGT9OPj3%2B3zmSZfAGxRXawdHXxj0h5gssQ3RwdHQFymlYmrZlN3FysgZpOM647GQhgVPlW4HV5TGQk2%2FAmh4asS97ZJDk0TTHFR5LQwuTQqLbP6CFqNJJJTUQX8d5QyVGmWuYCAkYUiSKa21Ay6bOW68vy6yapRoHNIjOVqB2qT8z9BIuLCZ%2BFixHusw7gpwzXFeVraYN%2FObQ%3D%3D","lengthInMinutes":195,"screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-06T14:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/145143"}]}]},{"date":"Fri Mar 07","films":[]},{"date":"Sat Mar 08","films":[]},{"date":"Sun Mar 09","films":[]},{"date":"Mon Mar 10","films":[]},{"date":"Tue Mar 11","films":[]},{"date":"Wed Mar 12","films":[]},{"date":"Thu Mar 13","films":[{"title":"A NIGHT WITH JANIS JOPLIN: THE MUSICAL","description":"This multi award-winning show captured recently at the Sadler’s Wells Peacock Theatre is an extraordinary musical journey paying homage to Janis Joplin and her biggest musical influences.
