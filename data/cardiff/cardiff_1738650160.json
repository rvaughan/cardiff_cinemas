show captured recently at the Sadler’s Wells Peacock Theatre is an extraordinary musical journey paying homage to Janis Joplin and her biggest musical influences. \n\nLike a comet that burns far too brightly to last, Janis Joplin exploded onto the music scene in 1967 and, almost overnight, became the queen of rock & roll. The unmistakable voice, filled with raw emotion and tinged with Southern Comfort, made her a must-see headliner from Monterey to Woodstock. \n\nFuelled by such unforgettable songs as “Me and Bobby McGee,” “Piece of My Heart”, “Mercedes Benz”, “Cry Baby” and “Summertime”, a remarkable cast and breakout performances. \n\nA Night with Janis Joplin, written and directed by Randy Johnson, is a musical journey celebrating Janis and her biggest musical influences—icons like Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Odetta, Nina Simone and Bessie Smith, who inspired one of rock ‘n roll’s greatest legends.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ANIGHTWITHJANISJOPLIN%3ATHEMUSICAL.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=QkalYGJp0G9w6i8ezy%2FW77W1gLQ6R5g%2B%2B0VVyoDpZgvMMENTuOkxhLYnumH7FvjEel%2BkK01ajjpL%2BACOmXESQiSnAPnFOU9dLhQN0iLfBfOTURinMPBld5aWqRDOzmqCZn3aFzuFNnSxMu8AI22fCpKiCKiK3QL12Ybd7ex%2FgNqD5YmomSgP%2FQzK%2BXSnlzjm5yCBLimRZ%2BFBP6gQj7RszFM5YmOPnGqxyguKSMJM7qfjI0Q0V%2FGpdDntI3mRv9O6YOUao0tR8tqAZgqAEp%2BTa1nYfzvep%2FLA6YtqbhsImmLjwPtvVcUnIbAhUNZ56WW0i1mlA9eci8QcCIzGcLyNtw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 13 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-13T19:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/142694"},{"time":"2025-03-13T19:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37506"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 16 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-16T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/142696"}]}],"length_in_minutes":140},{"title":"A REAL PAIN","description":"Mismatched cousins David and Benji reunite for a tour through Poland to honor their beloved grandmother.

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BRIDGETJONES%3AMADABOUTTHEBOY.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=u4i%2Ff5pTLsJNA5InbP%2BRy82m74o90%2BhPg%2FRuKa%2FgFNtgEmxqdVokQ%2FjIp9GuclFH%2Fd9vdGE13Cva%2F2yQ8DT5pyGrGnkMdQB84i5GyocrggMS7aTFFNbRRVbd6Ubjmgk43eun3c7lWmDJbhgJ%2F4oD56ZAWVjbH8a9vvbj42X5fdvrmpZTRkYG%2B%2Bvr8NC08bMN4hQf4oV4jWh8EhuInnle1hhDFslA7UMlZ7z9%2BIYefc822KKva9e67ya9xh8GSmsy4Lkf5COX8h%2BRWtppxXnWmmFXdnNAd1yLnmXaZ5wX03tswvEYl0knK281%2F58JD7GMviumB23Q7rQRq8xYn%2FJqbQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU

powerhouses. CatVideoFest is a joyous communal experience, only available in theaters, and raises money for cats in need through partnerships with local cat charities, animal welfare organizations, and shelters to best serve cats in the area.\n\nWe are committed to raising awareness and money for cats in need around the world. A percentage of the proceeds from each event go to local animal shelters and/or animal welfare organizations. Since 2019, over $150,000 has been raised for local shelters in addition to adoptions, fostering, volunteer sign-ups and much more at shows.\n\nBy focusing our fundraising efforts on behalf of local shelters and organizations, we’re able to divert money and attention directly to the places and causes that need it most. We trust local people working on behalf of cats to know and understand the problems that need to be solved.\n\nThe 75-minute-reel of cat videos is family-friendly and can be enjoyed by anyone. The wide demographic appeal allows for it to be shown in virtually any type of setting - from museums to theaters to outdoor festivals and beyond. This flexibility means there are almost no limits to where CatVideoFest can go!","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/CATVIDEOFEST2024.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=g05WMsi9iYGveAzjoeCIb%2BQFjL0xWem7Aufr4Y5LqxJq%2Bi%2FtaWzg2B9NVDZnHCJkTgql4xb6zI0G1%2BBjdm9Llk%2Bta4%2Fw4DcHORRkixgMBu%2FtPe7%2BsWodOJgXkZkihSQxwhg1Ns%2FEhQgfh4hSpsbtrJC%2FnQ6YSJQGvANsc0oO1%2BnHR62NtLDUN7t%2Bu0X%2BvYDhU7LRZL55lPfxTiQbmTV%2BhwqY0VEmNQxGtYNNPxQaie5eT2hh%2BXAi1rarYQU5ZVOEHnmarj3sW3g2J6hLTlqxsvKq50kOll9zwge9B12xZt2psfUCQkdIovd4FS3F9IYxIxVZSQKqRTECqkc%2FZMj4Hg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 17 FEB","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-17T17:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-73635"}]}],"length_in_minutes":75},{"title":"COMPANION","description":"Hey you.

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.\n\nWhat led to that first ground-breaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874. See the show that changed everything on the big screen.\n\nMade in close collaboration with the Musee d’Orsay and National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.","rating":null,"image_link":null,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 18 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-18T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37637"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 19 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-19T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37636"}]}],"length_in_minutes":90},{"title":"FINDING NEMO","description":"Life along the Great Barrier Reef is full of dangers when you are a tiny clown fish. And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 22 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-22T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146607"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 23 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-23T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146608"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-23T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147012"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 01 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-01T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146609"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 02 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-02T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146610"}]}],"length_in_minutes":101},{"title":"FLIGHT RISK","description":"In this high-stakes suspense thriller, Academy Award® nominee Mark Wahlberg (Actor in a Supporting Role, 2006 – The Departed) plays a pilot transporting an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) accompanying a fugitive (Topher Grace) to trial.

His friend Minde does the same and they are practically sure, that physical strength and money are the essentials for success in this changing, competitive, capitalist society. But when Rimants meets and falls in love with the beautiful, middle class Monika, he is introduced to a new world of literature, culture and alternative possibilities which he explores with guarded enthusiasm.\n\nA portrait of a 90’ies generation with a lot of humour, music and the special slang of Šiauliai.\nThe film is based on the best-seller “Southerside Chronicles” by literary critic, poet and writer Rimantas Kmita. With this novel Kmita built a monument for his hometown, and inspired an interest spike in the location of the book - the very special Southern district of town

As the night stretches on, however, Blake begins to behave strangely, transforming into something unrecognizable, and Charlotte will be forced to decide whether the terror within their house is more

moment that forever changed media coverage and continues to impact live news today. Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SEPTEMBER5.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KFQZzUFDcIkH%2BTtxrG%2BABQL3jIUSu2hZ47GeU6Nju2HAVE%2FWmlLs8mKzzBqwxmI2FCdDGrn1hhJSiv%2FEz1RKNFN2irq4WdxMhoHzmXEOJhNgaQzlumEYlW2bNzmNhccTSD1At%2FbBNjYfZiGlJ%2FcdHaA2%2Fy3PcLwcR1UlDOJVpqNLy%2FEm9bJw1FryW8DkghfWZ3zfSK8LLbVmLe%2B4%2BRosKPzgNIsPHTT4AmeI%2Bz8OabWo6xfFsVZ%2F0GBeBr3IbeajV4k4ODsCup2dpNTcFq4SAYG0flXiKIW2lRvwczzKca0bt9wnypV7PToGDzz%2BwzOYPws%2Bh63pldMJVyWZiSjFvw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-05T19:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146564"},{"time":"2025-02-05T19:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=289562&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-05T20:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-73100"}]}]},{"title":"SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3","description":"Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails reunite against a powerful new adversary, Shadow, a mysterious villain with powers unlike anything they have faced before.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SONICTHEHEDGEHOG3.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=e1fYVqgjXg5YpGB1%2BnJX5OQdVj%2FzF5GArouYGFdQdK%2FTINJzy2lLjenq4UuaaolkRu89iqzP%2F%2BuJJNvBOeZsbT9msp5jVGFuTp3XP3lEVDz7bEJwzLLZ3LRLGH1dyTr%2B3lkecXJnEq90kTDspRIrOVwAFZS1ovBIO5O4CYnqBGYiTq2JkZTrAtgnDnIthAtlb6csbXRwHf9VksOIf6s3EyHpPV%2BXKHRr7prF9J0me%2FbhMp%2BxFp4CYZu1r10fFVGsr0pvZ48FW0dXGV0WOg9nzr3GCiFkoxNmMazR6%2F24IlKG0rjW8bYqwc7T0b0bmZoYou4LrGJvt%2BdjVRKw0HZEWA%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":110,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-05T11:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146876"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-05T11:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146799"},{"time":"2025-02-05T15:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74367"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-05T16:20:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146877"},{"time":"2025-02-05T16:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=289604&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-05T17:40:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00018921/284259","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-05T18:55:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146878"}]}]},{"title":"TABBY MCTAT + THE ROOM ON THE BROOM","description":"In the bustling heart of London Tabby McTat, a singing cat, and his busker friend Fred, entertain passing crowds with their duo singing act.

Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage.

Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral

reel of the latest and best cat videos culled from countless hours of unique submissions and sourced animations, music videos, and classic internet powerhouses. CatVideoFest is a joyous communal experience, only available in theaters, and raises money for cats in need through partnerships with local cat charities, animal welfare organizations, and shelters to best serve cats in the area.\n\nWe are committed to raising awareness and money for cats in need around the world. A percentage of the proceeds from each event go to local animal shelters and/or animal welfare organizations. Since 2019, over $150,000 has been raised for local shelters in addition to adoptions, fostering, volunteer sign-ups and much more at shows.\n\nBy focusing our fundraising efforts on behalf of local shelters and organizations, we’re able to divert money and attention directly to the places and causes that need it most.

And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 22 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-22T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146607"}]}]},{"title":"THE MONKEY","description":"When twin brothers Bill and Hal find their father's old monkey toy in the attic, a series of gruesome deaths start.

And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 23 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-23T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146608"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-23T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147012"}]}]},{"title":"HOOK","description":"","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HOOK.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=kR3dfNQ4mihFzRe9FMXCTYMvuxCse7XWRpzEKPD%2F0r2Y%2Fzm%2BYPOw140Gx6%2B8h4WqenQPnpHehq7r41t4MoQvF1WuQGAE64gXAf7vHt3XWKPB6jMIjscUt%2FkpHQ89ew%2BN5vo6xB8DHKBjLZuZHgxFgL5cn%2FUBq8vRzWMamgBoDQyofgiZxC8gzPHmyvpLYhoa3%2BRZhSBNZdNkk6HwBnjLQn4a8d8gmkBRAHrAqc3MAa0K6NxV2rvML2sFkr2XjuKc0Eq63IRrvEbBXiTXwtmRct3kBqMy9K1wdJbo%2BgMPLQoOzh3bkUCxl3awsPulDKB7eEA5H6N9tCbmhoEsNAJsrQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":136,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 23 FEB","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-23T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/38813"}]}]},{"title":"MUFASA: THE LION KING","description":"Simba, having become king of the Pride Lands, is determined for his cub to follow in his footsteps while the origins of his late father Mufasa are explored.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/MUFASA%3ATHELIONKING.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=zJM0hg3ZeVXI7Z5tNxW90OQ3xxAqUO%2BnhmvC8U8VbBStNuxWl15k5oUN0lV3rvkuBSJiVhZxVxCSSRbUNvjbk33pC8VgTEFFKp5DeycUUMgao1nQ%2F7INoMBVBzhxwJt9Tq1Q0%2FGgtzBVMSNs4wChYGw3fYjy%2FYIeNsGlNxF8UeFo2eplMgbrbawqDkxlHx7TRFJmlLbrrWE59S0tWdQy3eYQJ5KKXiLeXinVVwo%2Bx7ihJ113tinVrY0FDHge0d4ux7juG9exlLa2Agn0A9c0y53lpqHBrzeGP6sfvyTresnFfTcFS0D1Gf29rQOGhreoE9i4mCxPK1teGqepLYiJJw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":118,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 23 FEB","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-23T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00018857/284467","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}]},{"title":"NT LIVE: THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST","description":"Three-time Olivier Award-winner Sharon D Clarke is joined by Ncuti Gatwa (Doctor Who; Sex Education) in this joyful reimagining of Oscar Wilde’s most celebrated comedy.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/NTLIVE%3ATHEIMPORTANCEOFBEINGEARNEST.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ZHkFl3gjVKy5%2BngwaSBDUbyzFKqzssimtbxdcZmMfER1P%2FOAhpAvvMNe%2BybvLBSew%2F09OV%2BlMEahUBuxMe2x78t4i9F7SnZ0mxcEkBIZo1KOOeuoKOAWhO7XJeQfIdc6w0tNvm66nhZvR4%2F7ptUTlwKc2R8lwyQcLfa2WimiQjaYGoVGVILv%2BxSUdWCNRwih5K625eYYZcZoIT3ixtADTVGX9Y67HLwcjPNRwHnDYx3g2WzG%2F3g6L8KiXJFx7zaDhOIAQeuGQi8uzhewXoeVjlzneETA%2FCJgMCMx2ISVhUYLVUPD7BPdzK0%2B7vUfXqRfxn33pVNEXth%2BTfcmnyeh2Q%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":170,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 23 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-23T13:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/137645"},{"time":"2025-02-23T14:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=281074&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-23T14:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-73119"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-23T17:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147006"}]}]},{"title":"THE MONKEY","description":"When twin brothers Bill and Hal find their father's old monkey toy in the attic, a series of gruesome deaths start.

And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 02 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-02T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146610"}]}]},{"title":"JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR LIVE","description":"Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s rock classic Jesus Christ Superstar returns to its roots with this sensational performance filmed in the UK during the Live Arena Tour.

Like a comet that burns far too brightly to last, Janis Joplin exploded onto the music scene in 1967 and, almost overnight, became the queen of rock & roll.
