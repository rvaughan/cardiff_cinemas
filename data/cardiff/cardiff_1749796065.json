One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as

MOVIE","description":"Dubbed “the greatest that never was,” Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) was FORMULA 1’s most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career.  Thirty years later, he’s a nomadic racer-for-hire when he’s approached by his former teammate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), owner of a struggling FORMULA 1 team that is on the verge of collapse.  Ruben convinces Sonny to come back to FORMULA 1 for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world.  He’ll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace.  But as the engines roar, Sonny’s past catches up with him and he finds that in FORMULA 1, your teammate is your fiercest competition—and the road to redemption is not something you can travel alone.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/F1THEMOVIE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=Puo%2BfrCkLKu%2B%2Fy2cm2fAhpSMgy725%2BY%2FT1DLH2OrAW7klnoJyVGaV%2BPGlaeBTXDcyiGGCSTZBMXWELaUJPMxmZPdux%2FPDAtY20KE%2FzxjesFASiKW16ftZHpdeKadHjHu0CFe%2BKJhLAGOp7L4JR7T%2BXWcSWdfzUKaDH%2FlMYzu0nrXXCrQxlPUbP9%2FRwJ%2BYjczVpUqRRA5hQ%2Buujgf4JnooAIQn8vPSg2iwyn4PBWgXJv3tHX2%2B67%2FKbi8HmaGRkLNY8BpJjrKYnYNYOapZ%2BQcNpEqe9d%2Fe1W2gx2eylQi80%2BFSk2zbgGf9zMOW3vnJEJ0JkuRbRHrlf92Q2WQGk19%2FQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED

determined to break barriers and obtain his amateur boxing license—the crucial first step toward his dream of becoming a professional fighter. But the real fight isn’t just in the ring; it’s against a system that continues to put up obstacles, reflecting the everyday struggles disabled people face simply to be included in society.\n\nFeaturing leading disability advocates such as Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson and 'Fury the Gladiator' (Jodie Ounsley), Fighters not only tells Matt’s story but educates and challenges a non-disabled audience to confront the deep-rooted inequalities disabled people still battle today.\nDespite living in an era of progress, disabled people are still fighting for inclusion—whether in sports, broadcasting, the arts, government, media, or business. While many have made a powerful impact, others continue to face unnecessary barriers to equality.\n\nFighters is more than just a film—it’s a wake-up call. A powerful, real-life portrayal of one man’s relentless pursuit of acceptance and an inspiring testament to the strength of the human spirit.\n\nThis is a film that needs to be seen—not just by the disabled community, but by everyone—because if you want something bad enough, you might just have to fight for it. A recorded Q&A will play after the film.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FIGHTERSQA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=RP9VXlRO2rCeBailxI0wyIVD4Jpcat4wpaSRx4mGqkeTQtLIbgseB0kDs8L1t%2FcEk336ahR%2BwQ09U7ce3OxjXBxYFwMVpBTS9Q1RFQRGX6OlsMRA62%2FDqW5GN5bfS%2Fwq50J%2F6%2BTVdntlqLF1oCVhXIKWgOk9raiyMeBKOsIdQ4FgPChWfhCr%2F%2F%2Bw8OqovyWWET4YXb%2BON7lYUoj0ZispXXrHav26y%2FvQvjMDX1aOaovZ6DWPCNdii5yi9FBvS6PdrC5PjfBXG8aNCEJj96DDS8RUh17Hx5QHyieTHRfiEf8s53raK7MyBrekCqyIAoxDgYmTGkTphu6gNu%2FYuV%2Fs3g%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 23 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-23T18:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-81760"}]}],"length_in_minutes":75},{"title":"FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES","description":"The newest chapter in New Line Cinema’s bloody successful franchise takes audiences back to the very beginning of Death’s twisted sense of justice.

Then, suddenly and mysteriously, house-elf Dobby appears in Harry's bedroom and warns him of great danger if he should attempt to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But despite the elf's mischievous efforts to thwart Harry's return to school, the ever-determined Harry is rescued from the Dursley's dreary clutches by Ron and his brothers and whisked into the warmth of the Weasley household. Upon arriving at Hogwarts, Harry finds that his first year heroics have caused him to become the center of much unwanted attention. His new fans include Ron's little sister Ginny; first year would-be photographer Colin Creevey; and most irritatingly, the New Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Gilderoy Lockhart. Outshone only by his own vanity, Lockhart craves the attention that Harry shuns. But not even Lockhart can offer an explanation for the sinister new terror that is gripping the school.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HARRYPOTTERANDTHECHAMBEROFSECRETS.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=us1ARgaCgnNPDZ%2BUzd8Lu46vXksgwAckaY3rFu1nc1JDmgyY%2FXfhBKIQlkRhnwCKlpLWI87pN7Ug2TqiHWY5dCGBrTRbVPSdXaZOZAc67%2BQViS7e8v5V7wTe2JmgPktwbqnZjP50ktLl%2BfR1blaatayAg5i7hkZotCcCSkRroyfrH476RIfbUcEBHniNEEs573LgfqYbAC1oIRP%2F2wbmkLdXq9iZHS5Ehi%2FiGIyQ3EXZzTOPvmKqg4FHyYpvZaP17o5orBrdiVH3KbK0BdCoQ2G%2F80VDOAEapDYX98JbZmEpjnTtbXRS9ShuDU54TdThghITv36d8KRDFvJquC9S8w%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 05 JUL","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-07-05T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154711"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 06 JUL","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-07-06T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154712"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 12 JUL","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-07-12T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154713"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 13 JUL","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-07-13T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154714"}]}],"length_in_minutes":158},{"title":"HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE","description":"A young wizard finds himself competing in a hazardous tournament between rival schools of magic, but he is distracted by recurring nightmares.","rating":"12a","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HARRYPOTTERANDTHEGOBLETOFFIRE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=LGCaYBoQqKFX%2FEeJLxGFdWu58PRJa%2Fz0MWSIQciAAhMu7XI6il8UypikZ6mK%2FVzQq%2BTLF3fBt%2B4yIrvbhojkmP7qsj6nN7l5VriZccriF3axYDIr5w7knhA%2F9S%2Fd%2FkHmcsN7TZtJdqnHBsPqB2Z%2BCztRmrdSoQsHoilPb5GsSx3oIAyn%2FhyNdZ4fAcKHdr%2F5LrhFHYBS4%2B8qrMtpmCnb6VhNck4ZkAOK47VpU7cE%2FaqgLfyflNfEWMYZL9Kvc%2F4KNuSUJ4wAcI0Jhx98CGuM0ID2QWmtdJzpv1B4Kv%2Bkrpeaog%2BqMQYSMGarZ2sSpjTBz1lwWOLC5bpH4TRv5YIO%2BA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 30 AUG","screenings":[{"time":"2025-08-30T14:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020382/288824","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"MON 01 SEPT","screenings":[{"time":"2025-09-01T18:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020382/288826","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":0},{"title":"HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE","description":"Harry Potter has learned to live with his bullying Uncle Vernon, his callous Aunt Petunia and the constant whining of his greedy, spoiled cousin Dudley.

Aunt Marge has always been particularly horrible to Harry and this time pushes him so far that he \"accidentally\" causes her to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift away! Fearing punishment from his Aunt and Uncle--and repercussions from Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, which strictly forbids students from using magic in the non-magic world--Harry escapes into the night. Along the way, Harry will try to make sense of Hermione's puzzling appearances and disappearances, with the help of Ron and the giant Hagrid, who has taken on a new position at Hogwarts as the Care of Magical Creatures teacher. A confrontation between Harry and the menacing Sirius Black seems inevitable, but what exactly is Professor Lupin's relationship with Black? What is the dark secret that Professor Snape is so eager to reveal? And just why is Ron's pet rat Scabbers so frantic to escape his grasp? Harry will need all of the courage, magic and support he can muster to answer these questions and uncover the truth behind Sirius Black and his ties to the gifted young wizard's mysterious past.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HARRYPOTTERANDTHEPRISONEROFAZKABAN.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=As14dtrQkMeIaC1ko3r03VHN2jvXF70jxnqoeor2JwUcjgRcQ0iz1sJ%2Bx4O1OjrzyUpO3IHl3tcAMewuKamZ5kWsugPTSV8II5CKHdPjdJSVh4L05%2FDlDSuG85MJ%2BNQwr9QohF%2FXLek99gZ65b%2FLusXneU%2Bezhh7plxkHbCvrZaO8wZBPbQLriTJm6P3Pvp%2BW6VGKbtaoL59Dig7qKdwPX2vqcFX2ju4JgMAEfe6gfp%2Fb73laR9ib4U8hlXDyFGXpv4c8cKiApXZ9ucZtT2%2BZECYi8H5%2FJKw72cnuood4dBqBcLVk9gQyQ66MyWHQvbzv3%2B8sInUhFRaNkLg1ymnfw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 02 AUG","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-08-02T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154719"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 03 AUG","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-08-03T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154720"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 09 AUG","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-08-09T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154721"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 10 AUG","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-08-10T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154722"}]}],"length_in_minutes":141},{"title":"HOT MILK","description":"","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HOTMILK.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=p5IuxsHPCwskt0cIzNCjKEf%2BW5wTszwXIhOHErSyeMxBcRLB2qcx%2FdcAH00ftauzlATwoqLR%2FgTryyrcNQ6N0JuWGbWW1zGwSvgy2h7FEduA3pKbDGUcpTFEFq3n%2B9Yo2kUJb8HOlGJ%2BTWSze2pQTWuqsJos9H0VAmvTlhzYl5eiGmBBP35EhRmD5qdPXtqCL7Ndf9Pm8rPkdf1lswZJJ4oFrfKpIkmoSYz%2FUQ2ciBrUoWPW7Gf%2FPZvajtkOnSq7nxWhIeoSo4s6sTLMdKSbSvFyX4UrkcpqxtpSJ4KxIadrZ%2FM89R4JO0D%2FY1GhSl%2Fco6DtTr%2Fq9c7yaRNO21qIVQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 15 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-15T17:15:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020180/289886","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 21 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-21T18:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020180/290160","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 29 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-29T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020180/289177","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"MON 30 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-30T18:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-82338"}]}],"length_in_minutes":93},{"title":"HOUSEFULL 5 A","description":"Aboard one of the World’s most luxurious 20 storey cruise ship, birthday celebrations for the billionaire Mr. Dobriyal are interrupted by his demise, triggering a frenzy as three imposters claiming to be his long-lost heirs named “Jollys\" vie for his fortune.

On the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. With the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. As an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HOWTOTRAINYOURDRAGON.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=iU1Kyq1jvFhDGK%2BUtvM47e7Cn%2FUd%2F6mjYYme1heGy3eipgjIag%2FYYPyAUXi5Xkpmme36Dk%2BPa0UuZvX1AVm%2BsWF7y1%2FUDL8shTbjeLrkNh8lh%2BPVLXkvDEm7d5Of0arw5uYXCuEd0%2BKjaaxfkAenPVni0pwIGGRoCO5yMCXbwAW9HxGBFzMIESV1houz0js10nvEtC6iPdeTvyQN%2Fv9Lr8SyXx8pyD1JvGmFEA2it7OkIjkQ3wIIbOVRr2Dn5p9CgE1L8OhpUKKR4a6XpyI69WutY2xsTA3viA155GCm02ZDNUL7j1uaRu9E%2F5jsqU3I%2BhQZPxvPnmK4o5VKV4wirQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-13T09:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman

In his new production, Rolando Villazón—the tenor who has embarked on a brilliant second career as a director—retains the opera’s original setting in the Swiss Alps but uses its somnambulant plot to explore the emotional and psychological valleys of the mind. Tenor Xabier Anduaga returns after his acclaimed 2023 Met debut in L’Elisir d’Amore, co-starring as Amina’s fiancé Elvino, alongside soprano Sydney Mancasola as her rival, Lisa, and bass Alexander Vinogradov as Count Rodolfo.

But when Cavaradossi helps an escaped prisoner, the lovers make a deadly enemy in the form of Baron Scarpia, Chief of Police. At the mercy of Scarpia’s twisted desires, Tosca is forced to make a horrific bargain: sleeping with the man she hates in order to save the man she loves. Can she find a way out? \nA star-studded cast includes soprano Anna Netrebko performing the role of Tosca, tenor Freddie De Tommaso as Cavaradossi, and bass-baritone Gerald Finley as Scarpia, with Music Director of The Royal Opera Jakub Hrůša conducting his first new production in the role.

Directed by Sean Evans and Roger Waters, the film combines iconic songs from his Pink Floyd days with those from his solo career, encompassing a timespan of sixty years. The show is a stunning indictment of the corporate dystopia in which we all struggle to survive, and a call to action to love, protect and share our precious and precarious planet home. \n\nDedicated to “our brothers and sisters all over the world who are engaged in the existential battle for the soul of humanity”, the movie is an extraordinary assault on the senses, not just musically and visually, but politically and philosophically as well. It captures performances of songs from some of the most influential albums of all time – The Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall, together with those from the most popular of Waters’ solo career, including Amused To Death and Is This The Life We Really Want? Brought together with his band and crew, the show is majestic, with performances that are powerful yet controlled. \n\nThe sense of control is emphasised by the 360° stage. It provides intimacy and allows the performers to play to all sections of the audience “in the round”. With a rectangular centre with runways extending from each side, creating an elongated cross. Above it is a set of giant LED screens configured the same way. Made up of 12 surfaces, and totalling a huge 650 square meters, they project numerous images and messages that vividly and powerfully reinforce the meanings behind the songs. Because of the size and position of the screens, they can be seen throughout the arena and promote a high-energy production with maximum audience participation.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ROGERWATERSTHISISNOTADRILLLIVEFROMPRAGUETHEMOVIE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=nyJBAvv5l4VknYHfVCv0lSEwO0vb0EfXDB2b%2B6m3tGFBtPPDZfieP2YwodlcCECOgPq4xj1C2cifVbGl2DWMa2%2BdIJVgYhyg6lLH9PNJNuA38qBrrmxnqvuRxlZ08aFZmBAqZZrFk633E5lhgSZoKPhYSXxaivAAbbnjlxERKijosSwl063p%2Fvl9Tf1XUAwVxqv%2FXgoevco406JH6szSAw4am94P0br7ZXqm1H7X4OvLLNLU6zneDIej7n2dMQ4E0O4tadkVs3EIpL19hU38X%2ByegV8U49sZaH5qtud062uJYOtkl2f9rFpahsEySVqABUL1iqJE0bvxXf9CjFXMOw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 23 JUL","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-07-23T18:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/155003"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 27 JUL","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-07-27T14:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/155002"}]}],"length_in_minutes":144},{"title":"ROYAL BALLET AND OPERA: CINDERELLA","description":"Stuck at home and put to work by her spoiled Step-Sisters, Cinderella’s life is dreary and dull.

Forced to balance their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond, they must defend Earth from a ravenous space god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson) and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer (Julia Garner). And if Galactus’ plan to devour the entire planet and everyone on it weren’t bad enough, it suddenly gets very personal.

its home away, a solitary cat must seek refuge with a motley crew of animals, who gradually learn to get along in this endearing, Oscar-winning animation.\n\nWunderkind director Gints Zilbalodis has taken the animation world by storm with his beautifully crafted sophomore feature Flow, which has received a multitude of awards and nominations to date, including two nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards.  \n\nThe mystical world he creates in Flow is in peril. There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-13T08:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/42069"}]}]},{"title":"FRIDAY THE 13TH","description":"On Friday, June 13th of 1958, two Camp Crystal Lake counselors, Claudette and Barry, slip away from the campfire for an illicit rendezvous.

its home away, a solitary cat must seek refuge with a motley crew of animals, who gradually learn to get along in this endearing, Oscar-winning animation.\n\nWunderkind director Gints Zilbalodis has taken the animation world by storm with his beautifully crafted sophomore feature Flow, which has received a multitude of awards and nominations to date, including two nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards.  \n\nThe mystical world he creates in Flow is in peril. There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-14T08:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-82098"},{"time":"2025-06-14T08:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/42056"}]}]},{"title":"FROM THE WORLD OF JOHN WICK: BALLERINA","description":"The world of John Wick expands in Ballerina, where Ana de Armas stars as an assassin trained in the deadly traditions of the Ruska Roma, on a mission for revenge after her father’s death.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FROMTHEWORLDOFJOHNWICKBALLERINA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=b%2FOuHRNPPRihwO9j8GWEqT86%2BLtgrrVxXppLdWXrcRxrV8XDi0t7ZVw8909UDhMj1NdGIoIf%2BPjq3LXtEPmuXdOe5due9U3rtLdEyioVnhK3xy5M1qcNi%2BiottylUhsGzLTaddv1ZPJfQdpgfsYoePNSgDW0ZTzCTJJwT0WzrUQGSSi52dZ5lnc%2BsDMrqWKL0ql9ad7NXwFRh7XzQvVQtzpJs1TOmZ4jFRV2ObXtVcmQCzKBPhrWjxInH9gfbmP4ACmSS7JIgln0jPTViw8DMES3Y1RJvq6BES%2F7%2FahW9RC77K7lprqk7IEWAmqUuXwsjGWL%2B35JgQmQZOmi%2FvSU0w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":125,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-14T19:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/42067"}]}]},{"title":"HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE","description":"Harry Potter has learned to live with his bullying Uncle Vernon, his callous Aunt Petunia and the constant whining of his greedy, spoiled cousin Dudley. He's even learned to live with sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs. Harry's relatives have just as reluctantly learned to live with the unwelcome presence of their orphaned relation, a constant reminder of Petunia's \"wayward\" sister and brother-in-law and their mysterious and untimely demise. Even the impending arrival of his 11th birthday offers no excitement for Harry- as usual, there's little chance of cards, presents or any kind of birthday treat. This year, however, is different. On his 11th birthday, Harry learns that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. Invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime.

seek refuge with a motley crew of animals, who gradually learn to get along in this endearing, Oscar-winning animation.\n\nWunderkind director Gints Zilbalodis has taken the animation world by storm with his beautifully crafted sophomore feature Flow, which has received a multitude of awards and nominations to date, including two nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards.  \n\nThe mystical world he creates in Flow is in peril. There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen. \n","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":85,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 15 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-15T08:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-82102"},{"time":"2025-06-15T08:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/42096"}]}]},{"title":"FRIDAY THE 13TH","description":"On Friday, June 13th of 1958, two Camp Crystal Lake counselors, Claudette and Barry, slip away from the campfire for an illicit rendezvous.

fighter. But the real fight isn’t just in the ring; it’s against a system that continues to put up obstacles, reflecting the everyday struggles disabled people face simply to be included in society.\n\nFeaturing leading disability advocates such as Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson and 'Fury the Gladiator' (Jodie Ounsley), Fighters not only tells Matt’s story but educates and challenges a non-disabled audience to confront the deep-rooted inequalities disabled people still battle today.\nDespite living in an era of progress, disabled people are still fighting for inclusion—whether in sports, broadcasting, the arts, government, media, or business. While many have made a powerful impact, others continue to face unnecessary barriers to equality.\n\nFighters is more than just a film—it’s a wake-up call. A powerful, real-life portrayal of one man’s relentless pursuit of acceptance and an inspiring testament to the strength of the human spirit.\n\nThis is a film that needs to be seen—not just by the disabled community, but by everyone—because if you want something bad enough, you might just have to fight for it. A recorded Q&A will play after the film.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FIGHTERSQA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=RP9VXlRO2rCeBailxI0wyIVD4Jpcat4wpaSRx4mGqkeTQtLIbgseB0kDs8L1t%2FcEk336ahR%2BwQ09U7ce3OxjXBxYFwMVpBTS9Q1RFQRGX6OlsMRA62%2FDqW5GN5bfS%2Fwq50J%2F6%2BTVdntlqLF1oCVhXIKWgOk9raiyMeBKOsIdQ4FgPChWfhCr%2F%2F%2Bw8OqovyWWET4YXb%2BON7lYUoj0ZispXXrHav26y%2FvQvjMDX1aOaovZ6DWPCNdii5yi9FBvS6PdrC5PjfBXG8aNCEJj96DDS8RUh17Hx5QHyieTHRfiEf8s53raK7MyBrekCqyIAoxDgYmTGkTphu6gNu%2FYuV%2Fs3g%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":75,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 23 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-23T18:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-81760"}]}]},{"title":"TANGERINE","description":"It's Christmas Eve in Tinseltown and Sin-Dee (newcomer Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) is back on the block.

There are blind mice in his food, a big, bad wolf in his bed, three little homeless pigs and more, all banished from their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad.

Determined to save their home--not to mention his own--Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona to be Farquaad's bride. Accompanying him on his mission is wisecracking Donkey, who will do anything for Shrek... except shut up.

Not only has he had to put up with his overbearing Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon Dursley and their dread of his magical abilities, but also it seems as if Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger have forgotten him, as they haven't replied to a single one of his letters. Then, suddenly and mysteriously, house-elf Dobby appears in Harry's bedroom and warns him of great danger if he should attempt to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But despite the elf's mischievous efforts to thwart Harry's return to school, the ever-determined Harry is rescued from the Dursley's dreary clutches by Ron and his brothers and whisked into the warmth of the Weasley household. Upon arriving at Hogwarts, Harry finds that his first year heroics have caused him to become the center of much unwanted attention. His new fans include Ron's little sister Ginny; first year would-be photographer Colin Creevey; and most irritatingly, the New Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Gilderoy Lockhart. Outshone only by his own vanity, Lockhart craves the attention that Harry shuns. But not even Lockhart can offer an explanation for the sinister new terror that is gripping the school.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HARRYPOTTERANDTHECHAMBEROFSECRETS.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=us1ARgaCgnNPDZ%2BUzd8Lu46vXksgwAckaY3rFu1nc1JDmgyY%2FXfhBKIQlkRhnwCKlpLWI87pN7Ug2TqiHWY5dCGBrTRbVPSdXaZOZAc67%2BQViS7e8v5V7wTe2JmgPktwbqnZjP50ktLl%2BfR1blaatayAg5i7hkZotCcCSkRroyfrH476RIfbUcEBHniNEEs573LgfqYbAC1oIRP%2F2wbmkLdXq9iZHS5Ehi%2FiGIyQ3EXZzTOPvmKqg4FHyYpvZaP17o5orBrdiVH3KbK0BdCoQ2G%2F80VDOAEapDYX98JbZmEpjnTtbXRS9ShuDU54TdThghITv36d8KRDFvJquC9S8w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":158,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT

Not only has he had to put up with his overbearing Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon Dursley and their dread of his magical abilities, but also it seems as if Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger have forgotten him, as they haven't replied to a single one of his letters. Then, suddenly and mysteriously, house-elf Dobby appears in Harry's bedroom and warns him of great danger if he should attempt to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But despite the elf's mischievous efforts to thwart Harry's return to school, the ever-determined Harry is rescued from the Dursley's dreary clutches by Ron and his brothers and whisked into the warmth of the Weasley household. Upon arriving at Hogwarts, Harry finds that his first year heroics have caused him to become the center of much unwanted attention. His new fans include Ron's little sister Ginny; first year would-be photographer Colin Creevey; and most irritatingly, the New Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Gilderoy Lockhart. Outshone only by his own vanity, Lockhart craves the attention that Harry shuns. But not even Lockhart can offer an explanation for the sinister new terror that is gripping the school.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HARRYPOTTERANDTHECHAMBEROFSECRETS.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=us1ARgaCgnNPDZ%2BUzd8Lu46vXksgwAckaY3rFu1nc1JDmgyY%2FXfhBKIQlkRhnwCKlpLWI87pN7Ug2TqiHWY5dCGBrTRbVPSdXaZOZAc67%2BQViS7e8v5V7wTe2JmgPktwbqnZjP50ktLl%2BfR1blaatayAg5i7hkZotCcCSkRroyfrH476RIfbUcEBHniNEEs573LgfqYbAC1oIRP%2F2wbmkLdXq9iZHS5Ehi%2FiGIyQ3EXZzTOPvmKqg4FHyYpvZaP17o5orBrdiVH3KbK0BdCoQ2G%2F80VDOAEapDYX98JbZmEpjnTtbXRS9ShuDU54TdThghITv36d8KRDFvJquC9S8w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":158,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 13 JUL","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-07-13T09:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154714"}]}]},{"title":"OPÉRA DE PARIS: MADAME BUTTERFLY","description":"During a temporary stay in Japan, American Pinkerton marries a geisha, Cio-Cio-San, to pleasantly pass the time until his departure.

Directed by Sean Evans and Roger Waters, the film combines iconic songs from his Pink Floyd days with those from his solo career, encompassing a timespan of sixty years. The show is a stunning indictment of the corporate dystopia in which we all struggle to survive, and a call to action to love, protect and share our precious and precarious planet home. \n\nDedicated to “our brothers and sisters all over the world who are engaged in the existential battle for the soul of humanity”, the movie is an extraordinary assault on the senses, not just musically and visually, but politically and philosophically as well. It captures performances of songs from some of the most influential albums of all time – The Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall, together with those from the most popular of Waters’ solo career, including Amused To Death and Is This The Life We Really Want? Brought together with his band and crew, the show is majestic, with performances that are powerful yet controlled. \n\nThe sense of control is emphasised by the 360° stage. It provides intimacy and allows the performers to play to all sections of the audience “in the round”. With a rectangular centre with runways extending from each side, creating an elongated cross. Above it is a set of giant LED screens configured the same way. Made up of 12 surfaces, and totalling a huge 650 square meters, they project numerous images and messages that vividly and powerfully reinforce the meanings behind the songs. Because of the size and position of the screens, they can be seen throughout the arena and promote a high-energy production with maximum audience participation.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ROGERWATERSTHISISNOTADRILLLIVEFROMPRAGUETHEMOVIE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=nyJBAvv5l4VknYHfVCv0lSEwO0vb0EfXDB2b%2B6m3tGFBtPPDZfieP2YwodlcCECOgPq4xj1C2cifVbGl2DWMa2%2BdIJVgYhyg6lLH9PNJNuA38qBrrmxnqvuRxlZ08aFZmBAqZZrFk633E5lhgSZoKPhYSXxaivAAbbnjlxERKijosSwl063p%2Fvl9Tf1XUAwVxqv%2FXgoevco406JH6szSAw4am94P0br7ZXqm1H7X4OvLLNLU6zneDIej7n2dMQ4E0O4tadkVs3EIpL19hU38X%2ByegV8U49sZaH5qtud062uJYOtkl2f9rFpahsEySVqABUL1iqJE0bvxXf9CjFXMOw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":144,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED

Directed by Sean Evans and Roger Waters, the film combines iconic songs from his Pink Floyd days with those from his solo career, encompassing a timespan of sixty years. The show is a stunning indictment of the corporate dystopia in which we all struggle to survive, and a call to action to love, protect and share our precious and precarious planet home. \n\nDedicated to “our brothers and sisters all over the world who are engaged in the existential battle for the soul of humanity”, the movie is an extraordinary assault on the senses, not just musically and visually, but politically and philosophically as well. It captures performances of songs from some of the most influential albums of all time – The Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall, together with those from the most popular of Waters’ solo career, including Amused To Death and Is This The Life We Really Want? Brought together with his band and crew, the show is majestic, with performances that are powerful yet controlled. \n\nThe sense of control is emphasised by the 360° stage. It provides intimacy and allows the performers to play to all sections of the audience “in the round”. With a rectangular centre with runways extending from each side, creating an elongated cross. Above it is a set of giant LED screens configured the same way. Made up of 12 surfaces, and totalling a huge 650 square meters, they project numerous images and messages that vividly and powerfully reinforce the meanings behind the songs. Because of the size and position of the screens, they can be seen throughout the arena and promote a high-energy production with maximum audience participation.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ROGERWATERSTHISISNOTADRILLLIVEFROMPRAGUETHEMOVIE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=nyJBAvv5l4VknYHfVCv0lSEwO0vb0EfXDB2b%2B6m3tGFBtPPDZfieP2YwodlcCECOgPq4xj1C2cifVbGl2DWMa2%2BdIJVgYhyg6lLH9PNJNuA38qBrrmxnqvuRxlZ08aFZmBAqZZrFk633E5lhgSZoKPhYSXxaivAAbbnjlxERKijosSwl063p%2Fvl9Tf1XUAwVxqv%2FXgoevco406JH6szSAw4am94P0br7ZXqm1H7X4OvLLNLU6zneDIej7n2dMQ4E0O4tadkVs3EIpL19hU38X%2ByegV8U49sZaH5qtud062uJYOtkl2f9rFpahsEySVqABUL1iqJE0bvxXf9CjFXMOw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":144,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN

But when Cavaradossi helps an escaped prisoner, the lovers make a deadly enemy in the form of Baron Scarpia, Chief of Police.
