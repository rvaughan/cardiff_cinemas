Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/EXHIBITIONONSCREENMICHELANGELOLOVEANDDEATH.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=RIKC4YjofCvL%2BTPjAl5V1DrWDT%2FujgKz2KlsvRhMkklwprbq4Kc9K0DhxFUn1B5fs9ZHr4ZLG2x0iqn%2Fv2W4yV4FuGf2%2BFIC6kREd%2FjIdum1FKxadwVX10VUdtUelZYxh1jfgmZBoYOmedNlMJQq197mYBQvIvWvy8J40T4CRoGsyNvo4hn%2FGWtSCfuDC7htD8A1w5Qgm0tNGqpj%2BUUC%2B5Txi42joHjLY%2FMz6WHUABBMtKM1jPxI%2FLKKtNq7hvJ7jt3lC7wDCq7l8NiGPDLeNmrvpv4ZZ55Wn4LlmWf5XBsGDJ8QPYzMASCfaDfeMSyn9aHxDhNNu%2F8PqmPxJDViMA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37640"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37639"}]}],"length_in_minutes":91},{"title":"FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES","description":"The newest chapter in New Line Cinema’s bloody successful franchise takes audiences back to the very beginning of Death’s twisted sense of justice.

Through spectacular sequences featuring coral reefs, kelp forests and the open ocean, Attenborough shares why a healthy ocean keeps the entire planet stable and flourishing.\n\nStunning, immersive cinematography showcases the wonder of life under the seas and exposes the realities and challenges facing our ocean as never-before-seen, from destructive fishing techniques to mass coral reef bleaching. Yet the story is one of optimism, with Attenborough pointing to inspirational stories from around the world to deliver his greatest message: the ocean can recover to a glory beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\n\nScreening in cinemas with theatrically exclusive footage.

MCMLXXII","description":"Pink Floyd at Pompeii – MCMLXXII, the groundbreaking 1972 film directed by Adrian Maben, returns to theaters, now digitally re-mastered in 4K from the original 35mm footage with enhanced audio. \nSet in the hauntingly beautiful ruins of the ancient Roman Amphitheater in Pompeii, Italy, the film captures Pink Floyd performing an intimate concert without an audience. Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release. Inspired by the golden warmth of Pompeii’s iconic setting, the remaster transforms this timeless piece into a masterpiece of sight and sound.

Instead, he’s thrown into a nation deeply divided by political unrest and a classroom of unruly students. Tom’s life takes an unexpected turn when he rescues a penguin stranded on an oil-slicked beach. As he cares for the creature, an unlikely friendship forms, offering Tom a fresh perspective on life.\n\nDirected by Peter Cattaneo, The Penguin Lessons is a heartfelt dramedy that blends humor with poignant moments. Coogan delivers a standout performance, bringing warmth and depth to a story of growth and unlikely companionship, even as the film subtly sidesteps the country’s darker historical context.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEPENGUINLESSONS.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=1ofcVOKoHjL%2B3HUCocBmu%2FmnRAsZLb%2FX0Lgq8Y9WForDbxDefGXR8q3oN2wykVCR6Fv4WA0QGiIxM1SL53bUbOrGmI18kWC51AKWP9stu%2FnI9nMB818tbrbR50GFT0aZPpXzgrEZ1FkkhNrQw%2BFSEm0wLAiwM6%2BkqwN3bJnisl9lRMSucTZyieS9TO3XJ94oZl47NcQ%2FzLT0lY8PNEZWTRugd%2Fgp185F3rkbNRxL15aIWly6RKmdcC31qsmI82RhthJG9VNvaZTyszq3ZhvkSB9nAPpx1aXEYUV9m52Rlb1a8Q79G9csc44jY2pHrdkIYCu0IfYL4OGNtmD8v2gmMg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-19T08:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41486"},{"time":"2025-05-19T16:45:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00019958/288552","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T14:50:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00019958/288540","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"time":"2025-05-20T15:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41511"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 21 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-21T10:15:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00019958/288625","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":110},{"title":"THE PHOENICIAN SCHEME","description":"The story of a family and a family business.

best-selling memoir by Raynor Winn.\n\nThe Salt Path is the profound true story of husband and wife, Raynor and Moth Winn’s 630-mile trek along the beautiful but rugged Cornish, Devon and Dorset coastline.\n\nAfter being forcibly removed from their home, they make the desperate decision to walk in the hope that, in nature, they will find solace and a sense of acceptance. With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination. The Salt Path is a journey that is exhilarating, challenging, and liberating in equal measure. A portrayal of home, how it can be lost and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.\n\nEach ticket includes a complimentary popcorn.","rating":"12A","image_link":null,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 29 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-29T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41308"}]}],"length_in_minutes":115},{"title":"UEFA EUROPA LEAGUE FINAL 2025","description":"","rating":"tbc","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/UEFAEUROPALEAGUEFINAL2025.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H490JGVfBREewz%2FysO0dwbTGXVsmoWtbAWyyjDoK30QiSO6C76nuSmsW94Fm4gDBBiozyclEwiyHOhFHEpllFLKjAVmx%2B7kVRwzF8Vd7b6zQyMzksg7ru8cfUUuOaDMKKE1ZWfvdqRvLLs15H3VEw2hUr1jDosYD10stJn%2FZSpoSBG9pY1pQfkIq%2F2kyVMfMonWHdEm7SRVI7Mo0V4Wnd6iUZYWicA%2BhYEfpR2vsbYHDeWDRRXz1LUbvDp4mRRPti%2Bj5LGXGAjHJ5NyG5JZWLEkVyVnJW4EMSrQisHhmjMz4DCr4G3iRsey2%2FBfUMCZ0sFcnTf1nKj4%2FcafQEihpEQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 21 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-21T18:45:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020401/288667","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":0},{"title":"UNTIL DAWN","description":"One year after her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they find themselves stalked by a masked killer and horrifically murdered one by one…only to wake up and find themselves back at the beginning of the same evening.

Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. \nThis meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release. Inspired by the golden warmth of Pompeii’s iconic setting, the remaster transforms this timeless piece into a masterpiece of sight and sound.

Ignoring the warnings of the terrified researcher who maintains that the chimps are infected, they begin to free the animals and are immediately subjected to a bloody attack from the enraged creatures. Twenty-eight days later, Cycle courier Jim awakes from a coma in the deserted intensive care unit of a London hospital. He wanders out into a church where he finds dead bodies piled in heaps on the chapel floor. A sudden explosion from a makeshift bomb heralds the arrival of fellow \"survivors\" Selina and Mark. They take Jim to safety and explain to him that this infection is transmitted by blood and overwhelms the infected victim with a murderous rage within seconds. Britain has been overrun, and they have no way of knowing if it has spread worldwide. Their only hope of survival may lie in the hands of a Manchester group of soldiers, as they claim to have the \"answer\" to infection and invite any survivors to join them at their blockade. Faced with no practical alternative, the group sets out northwards, unaware that the worst is yet to

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/EXHIBITIONONSCREENMICHELANGELOLOVEANDDEATH.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=RIKC4YjofCvL%2BTPjAl5V1DrWDT%2FujgKz2KlsvRhMkklwprbq4Kc9K0DhxFUn1B5fs9ZHr4ZLG2x0iqn%2Fv2W4yV4FuGf2%2BFIC6kREd%2FjIdum1FKxadwVX10VUdtUelZYxh1jfgmZBoYOmedNlMJQq197mYBQvIvWvy8J40T4CRoGsyNvo4hn%2FGWtSCfuDC7htD8A1w5Qgm0tNGqpj%2BUUC%2B5Txi42joHjLY%2FMz6WHUABBMtKM1jPxI%2FLKKtNq7hvJ7jt3lC7wDCq7l8NiGPDLeNmrvpv4ZZ55Wn4LlmWf5XBsGDJ8QPYzMASCfaDfeMSyn9aHxDhNNu%2F8PqmPxJDViMA%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all

With depleted resources, only a tent and some essentials between them, every step along the path is a testament to their growing strength and determination. The Salt Path is a journey that is exhilarating, challenging, and liberating in equal measure. A portrayal of home, how it can be lost and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.\n\nEach ticket includes a complimentary

LATER, in cinemas from June 19.\n\nAfter breaking into a primate research facility, a group of animal rights activists discover caged chimps chained up before banks of screens displaying horrifying, violent images. Ignoring the warnings of the terrified researcher who maintains that the chimps are infected, they begin to free the animals and are immediately subjected to a bloody attack from the enraged creatures. Twenty-eight days later, Cycle courier Jim awakes from a coma in the deserted intensive care unit of a London hospital. He wanders out into a church where he finds dead bodies piled in heaps on the chapel floor. A sudden explosion from a makeshift bomb heralds the arrival of fellow \"survivors\" Selina and Mark. They take Jim to safety and explain to him that this infection is transmitted by blood and overwhelms the infected victim with a murderous rage within seconds.
