multi-award-winning show captured recently at the Sadler’s Wells Peacock Theatre is an extraordinary musical journey paying homage to Janis Joplin and her biggest musical influences. \n\nLike a comet

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH

2024","description":"CatVideoFest is a compilation reel of the latest and best cat videos culled from countless hours of unique submissions and sourced animations, music videos, and classic internet powerhouses. CatVideoFest is a joyous communal experience, only available in theaters, and raises money for cats in need through partnerships with local cat charities, animal welfare organizations, and shelters to best serve cats in the area.\n\nWe are committed to raising awareness and money for cats in need around the world. A percentage of the proceeds from each event go to local animal shelters and/or animal welfare organizations. Since 2019, over $150,000 has been raised for local shelters in addition to adoptions, fostering, volunteer sign-ups and much more at shows.\n\nBy focusing our fundraising efforts on behalf of local shelters and organizations, we’re able to divert money and attention directly to the places and causes that need it most. We trust local people working on behalf of cats to know and understand the problems that need to be solved.\n\nThe 75-minute-reel of cat videos is family-friendly and can be enjoyed by anyone. The wide demographic appeal allows for it to be shown in virtually any type of setting - from museums to theaters to outdoor festivals and beyond. This flexibility means there are almost no limits to where CatVideoFest can go!","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/CATVIDEOFEST2024.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=g05WMsi9iYGveAzjoeCIb%2BQFjL0xWem7Aufr4Y5LqxJq%2Bi%2FtaWzg2B9NVDZnHCJkTgql4xb6zI0G1%2BBjdm9Llk%2Bta4%2Fw4DcHORRkixgMBu%2FtPe7%2BsWodOJgXkZkihSQxwhg1Ns%2FEhQgfh4hSpsbtrJC%2FnQ6YSJQGvANsc0oO1%2BnHR62NtLDUN7t%2Bu0X%2BvYDhU7LRZL55lPfxTiQbmTV%2BhwqY0VEmNQxGtYNNPxQaie5eT2hh%2BXAi1rarYQU5ZVOEHnmarj3sW3g2J6hLTlqxsvKq50kOll9zwge9B12xZt2psfUCQkdIovd4FS3F9IYxIxVZSQKqRTECqkc%2FZMj4Hg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 17 FEB","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-17T17:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-73635"}]}],"length_in_minutes":75},{"title":"CHHAAVA","description":"A historical drama based on the life of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/CHHAAVA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=F1G22LFKVMM7JhDQDrrXIHDtTWhU6TnJlVmFwk8pFabWN6Mb9EHc6iFVMelxxpsopIdP67q1pRSX1I5ItNJHvOEQved3KZBZm9BeQXCgJQeoZ5c9yA6v1yPL90YPC%2F3tXYrl%2FDpddH%2Bre0FBYxkDZcPR8kWltfBgJN5ksdljaskO2IWwRV0Tc%2BDu1WgMv9Z3wa1wDKJvsqqscsv9sUKx6wbLTAiyGKm7vNLujx8UU9z8ykvHIxuA2Ji%2F%2F3PAXtyCdk53%2Fv23F%2B5WL00YpmucYb8ommGHtaR5BH21fiKlhncRTjlZnNa5JLZGCq5k8OuAVt52em%2FAo1HrqD0BpWeNkA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 14 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-14T20:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147388"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 15 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-15T20:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147389"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 16 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-16T16:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147390"}]}],"length_in_minutes":155},{"title":"COMPANION","description":"Hey you.

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.\n\nWhat led to that first ground-breaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874. See the show that changed everything on the big screen.\n\nMade in close collaboration with the Musee d’Orsay and National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.","rating":null,"image_link":null,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 18 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-18T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37637"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 19 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-19T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37636"}]}],"length_in_minutes":90},{"title":"FINDING NEMO","description":"Marlin, a clown fish, is overly cautious with his son, Nemo, who has a foreshortened fin.

But when an evil force threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, that same evil has\nreturned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people. However, along her journey, she’ll learn that it’ll take more than a dragon to save the world—it’s going to take trust and teamwork as well. Raya and the Last Dragon\nfeatures the voices of Kelly Marie Tran as Raya, a warrior whose wit is as sharp as her blade, and Awkwafina as the magical, mythical, self-deprecating dragon named Sisu. Characters also include a street-savvy 10-year-old \n entrepreneur named Boun, the formidable giant Tong and a thieving toddler Noi with her band of Ongis. Directed by Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada and produced by Osnat Shurer and Peter Del Vecho.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/RAYAANDTHELASTDRAGON.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=XVfc7QMd7%2B%2FsKQfcEd5PA0LqVzP1KbzAmWueCW9yXHwUQengL%2B7PWSJOn3zQY%2Fb%2FjMvl1PN%2F50syqbDcqrRHowvwsA%2FsTuU%2Bd4z16K3D0GPqF2I8CCGIJnqXOcwYe9qUeK%2FETT77xqTrxz8ZdtU8hEu4vfWoUmSeJ2CEUKwzMRt4GhK1O433j%2B%2FqbrfwOaG20hBpNNxJ%2BCQsJpL8UDQskhG5sqhShhA5FWhuM5%2Fk9TVfpMKwosBDLQu82qcG9be1YyhzHSQG%2FUP9PHTJbVEahVQi5JUNenxOK4zO3gpTxw%2Bl%2F9LBTlXwgCkfV6wiGhK8zco4oDMdiE3tjiRkGq6hSA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-08T10:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=289846&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-08T10:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020052/284584","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-09T10:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=289812&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-09T10:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020052/284478","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":114},{"title":"RBO 2024-25: SWAN LAKE","description":"Prince Siegfried chances upon a flock of swans while out hunting.

Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time.\n\nAt the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SEPTEMBER5.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KFQZzUFDcIkH%2BTtxrG%2BABQL3jIUSu2hZ47GeU6Nju2HAVE%2FWmlLs8mKzzBqwxmI2FCdDGrn1hhJSiv%2FEz1RKNFN2irq4WdxMhoHzmXEOJhNgaQzlumEYlW2bNzmNhccTSD1At%2FbBNjYfZiGlJ%2FcdHaA2%2Fy3PcLwcR1UlDOJVpqNLy%2FEm9bJw1FryW8DkghfWZ3zfSK8LLbVmLe%2B4%2BRosKPzgNIsPHTT4AmeI%2Bz8OabWo6xfFsVZ%2F0GBeBr3IbeajV4k4ODsCup2dpNTcFq4SAYG0flXiKIW2lRvwczzKca0bt9wnypV7PToGDzz%2BwzOYPws%2Bh63pldMJVyWZiSjFvw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-08T10:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman

full of dangers when you are a tiny clown fish. And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-08T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/38870"}]}]},{"title":"FLIGHT RISK","description":"In this high-stakes suspense thriller, Academy Award® nominee Mark Wahlberg (Best Supporting Actor, The Departed, 2006) plays a pilot transporting an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) accompanying a fugitive (Topher Grace) to trial.

Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral

decisive moment that forever changed media coverage and continues to impact live news today. Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral

moment that forever changed media coverage and continues to impact live news today. Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SEPTEMBER5.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KFQZzUFDcIkH%2BTtxrG%2BABQL3jIUSu2hZ47GeU6Nju2HAVE%2FWmlLs8mKzzBqwxmI2FCdDGrn1hhJSiv%2FEz1RKNFN2irq4WdxMhoHzmXEOJhNgaQzlumEYlW2bNzmNhccTSD1At%2FbBNjYfZiGlJ%2FcdHaA2%2Fy3PcLwcR1UlDOJVpqNLy%2FEm9bJw1FryW8DkghfWZ3zfSK8LLbVmLe%2B4%2BRosKPzgNIsPHTT4AmeI%2Bz8OabWo6xfFsVZ%2F0GBeBr3IbeajV4k4ODsCup2dpNTcFq4SAYG0flXiKIW2lRvwczzKca0bt9wnypV7PToGDzz%2BwzOYPws%2Bh63pldMJVyWZiSjFvw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON

moment that forever changed media coverage and continues to impact live news today. Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral

moment that forever changed media coverage and continues to impact live news today. Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SEPTEMBER5.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KFQZzUFDcIkH%2BTtxrG%2BABQL3jIUSu2hZ47GeU6Nju2HAVE%2FWmlLs8mKzzBqwxmI2FCdDGrn1hhJSiv%2FEz1RKNFN2irq4WdxMhoHzmXEOJhNgaQzlumEYlW2bNzmNhccTSD1At%2FbBNjYfZiGlJ%2FcdHaA2%2Fy3PcLwcR1UlDOJVpqNLy%2FEm9bJw1FryW8DkghfWZ3zfSK8LLbVmLe%2B4%2BRosKPzgNIsPHTT4AmeI%2Bz8OabWo6xfFsVZ%2F0GBeBr3IbeajV4k4ODsCup2dpNTcFq4SAYG0flXiKIW2lRvwczzKca0bt9wnypV7PToGDzz%2BwzOYPws%2Bh63pldMJVyWZiSjFvw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED

Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. Through this lens, \"September 5\" provides a fresh perspective on the live broadcast seen globally by an estimated one billion people at the time. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, the legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SEPTEMBER5.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KFQZzUFDcIkH%2BTtxrG%2BABQL3jIUSu2hZ47GeU6Nju2HAVE%2FWmlLs8mKzzBqwxmI2FCdDGrn1hhJSiv%2FEz1RKNFN2irq4WdxMhoHzmXEOJhNgaQzlumEYlW2bNzmNhccTSD1At%2FbBNjYfZiGlJ%2FcdHaA2%2Fy3PcLwcR1UlDOJVpqNLy%2FEm9bJw1FryW8DkghfWZ3zfSK8LLbVmLe%2B4%2BRosKPzgNIsPHTT4AmeI%2Bz8OabWo6xfFsVZ%2F0GBeBr3IbeajV4k4ODsCup2dpNTcFq4SAYG0flXiKIW2lRvwczzKca0bt9wnypV7PToGDzz%2BwzOYPws%2Bh63pldMJVyWZiSjFvw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 13 FEB","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-13T10:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39025"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-13T11:50:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147060"},{"time":"2025-02-13T12:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39010"},{"time":"2025-02-13T12:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74650"},{"time":"2025-02-13T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=289908&lang=en-GB"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-13T14:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147061"},{"time":"2025-02-13T15:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=289814&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-13T15:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74651"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-13T16:40:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146613"},{"time":"2025-02-13T17:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=289815&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-13T17:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74652"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-13T19:05:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146612"},{"time":"2025-02-13T20:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=289816&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-13T20:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74653"},{"time":"2025-02-13T21:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/38352"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-13T21:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146611"}]}]},{"title":"SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3","description":"Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails reunite against a powerful new adversary, Shadow, a mysterious villain with powers unlike anything they have faced before.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SONICTHEHEDGEHOG3.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=e1fYVqgjXg5YpGB1%2BnJX5OQdVj%2FzF5GArouYGFdQdK%2FTINJzy2lLjenq4UuaaolkRu89iqzP%2F%2BuJJNvBOeZsbT9msp5jVGFuTp3XP3lEVDz7bEJwzLLZ3LRLGH1dyTr%2B3lkecXJnEq90kTDspRIrOVwAFZS1ovBIO5O4CYnqBGYiTq2JkZTrAtgnDnIthAtlb6csbXRwHf9VksOIf6s3EyHpPV%2BXKHRr7prF9J0me%2FbhMp%2BxFp4CYZu1r10fFVGsr0pvZ48FW0dXGV0WOg9nzr3GCiFkoxNmMazR6%2F24IlKG0rjW8bYqwc7T0b0bmZoYou4LrGJvt%2BdjVRKw0HZEWA%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":110,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 13 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-13T16:05:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147161"},{"time":"2025-02-13T16:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=289941&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"THE BRUTALIST","description":"When visionary architect László Toth and his wife Erzsébet flee post-war Europe in 1947 to rebuild their legacy and witness the birth of modern America, their lives are changed forever by a mysterious and wealthy client.

reel of the latest and best cat videos culled from countless hours of unique submissions and sourced animations, music videos, and classic internet powerhouses. CatVideoFest is a joyous communal experience, only available in theaters, and raises money for cats in need through partnerships with local cat charities, animal welfare organizations, and shelters to best serve cats in the area.\n\nWe are committed to raising awareness and money for cats in need around the world. A percentage of the proceeds from each event go to local animal shelters and/or animal welfare organizations. Since 2019, over $150,000 has been raised for local shelters in addition to adoptions, fostering, volunteer sign-ups and much more at shows.\n\nBy focusing our fundraising efforts on behalf of local shelters and organizations, we’re able to divert money and attention directly to the places and causes that need it most. We trust local people working on behalf of cats to know and understand the problems that need to be solved.\n\nThe 75-minute-reel of cat videos is family-friendly and can be enjoyed by anyone. The wide demographic appeal allows for it to be shown in virtually any type of setting - from museums to theaters to outdoor festivals and beyond. This flexibility means there are almost no limits to where CatVideoFest can go!","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/CATVIDEOFEST2024.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=g05WMsi9iYGveAzjoeCIb%2BQFjL0xWem7Aufr4Y5LqxJq%2Bi%2FtaWzg2B9NVDZnHCJkTgql4xb6zI0G1%2BBjdm9Llk%2Bta4%2Fw4DcHORRkixgMBu%2FtPe7%2BsWodOJgXkZkihSQxwhg1Ns%2FEhQgfh4hSpsbtrJC%2FnQ6YSJQGvANsc0oO1%2BnHR62NtLDUN7t%2Bu0X%2BvYDhU7LRZL55lPfxTiQbmTV%2BhwqY0VEmNQxGtYNNPxQaie5eT2hh%2BXAi1rarYQU5ZVOEHnmarj3sW3g2J6hLTlqxsvKq50kOll9zwge9B12xZt2psfUCQkdIovd4FS3F9IYxIxVZSQKqRTECqkc%2FZMj4Hg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":75,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 17 FEB","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-17T17:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-73635"}]}]},{"title":"DOG MAN","description":"When a faithful police dog and his human police officer owner are injured together on the job, a harebrained but life-saving surgery fuses the two of them together.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/DOGMAN.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=jc3QSGghUfbNtmTTWSAYqhce0%2F4M2KJ8cZhnhHHcXuvJvjHOZAEAk%2BlNucBrCwVmBTuT4sAfLUBPaUYcQABvwo1iVpTM3F76i5xJI3gl5o5rfyT9cdjaXqS5zvwEtZOKPNN%2Faas7GyCcTyKy6W1Ush4GsjdXk7yO4uKkeYJcMLApwl5COeGV6BoKvUEmlpt5bkMvcgGgOUkUZ9r84n4BrPBBmygvgASC2AylmxXPb%2BCfvY1H9DK65Wo5ibtvg8SDVi4DXXoIAoKay9dGPRCxpWFf3U2XR4FLID9N5JTTL1S0jbabECKSVBic9dtI3%2B1A85yB%2BprGZqqCAuH3vMen6Q%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":89,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 17 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-17T12:20:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147360"},{"time":"2025-02-17T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74101"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-17T14:40:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147361"},{"time":"2025-02-17T15:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74102"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-17T17:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147362"},{"time":"2025-02-17T17:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74103"}]}]},{"title":"MYSTERY INSIDER SCREENING 4","description":"It’s time for more gruesome encounters!

And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT

When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 23 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-23T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147012"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-23T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146608"}]}]},{"title":"HOOK","description":"When his young children are abducted by his old nemesis, Capt.

And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 01 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-01T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146609"}]}]},{"title":"IVE THE 1ST WORLD TOUR IN CINEMA","description":"Dive into IVE!

And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 02 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-02T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146610"}]}]},{"title":"JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR LIVE","description":"Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s rock classic Jesus Christ Superstar returns to its roots with this sensational performance filmed in the UK during the Live Arena Tour.
