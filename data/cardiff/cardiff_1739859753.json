multi-award-winning show captured recently at the Sadler’s Wells Peacock Theatre is an extraordinary musical journey paying homage to Janis Joplin and her biggest musical influences. \n\nLike a comet that burns far too brightly to last, Janis Joplin exploded onto the music scene in 1967 and, almost overnight, became the queen of rock & roll. The unmistakable voice, filled with raw emotion and tinged with Southern Comfort, made her a must-see headliner from Monterey to Woodstock. \n\nFuelled by such unforgettable songs as “Me and Bobby McGee,” “Piece of My Heart”, “Mercedes Benz”, “Cry Baby” and “Summertime”, a remarkable cast and breakout performances. \n\nA Night with Janis Joplin, written and directed by Randy Johnson, is a musical journey celebrating Janis and her biggest musical influences—icons like Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Odetta, Nina Simone and Bessie Smith, who inspired one of rock ‘n roll’s greatest legends.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ANIGHTWITHJANISJOPLIN%3ATHEMUSICAL.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=QkalYGJp0G9w6i8ezy%2FW77W1gLQ6R5g%2B%2B0VVyoDpZgvMMENTuOkxhLYnumH7FvjEel%2BkK01ajjpL%2BACOmXESQiSnAPnFOU9dLhQN0iLfBfOTURinMPBld5aWqRDOzmqCZn3aFzuFNnSxMu8AI22fCpKiCKiK3QL12Ybd7ex%2FgNqD5YmomSgP%2FQzK%2BXSnlzjm5yCBLimRZ%2BFBP6gQj7RszFM5YmOPnGqxyguKSMJM7qfjI0Q0V%2FGpdDntI3mRv9O6YOUao0tR8tqAZgqAEp%2BTa1nYfzvep%2FLA6YtqbhsImmLjwPtvVcUnIbAhUNZ56WW0i1mlA9eci8QcCIzGcLyNtw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 13 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-13T19:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/142694"},{"time":"2025-03-13T19:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37506"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 16 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-16T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/142696"}]}],"length_in_minutes":140},{"title":"A REAL PAIN","description":"Mismatched cousins David (Jesse Eisenberg) and Benji (Kieran Culkin) reunite for a tour through Poland to honor their beloved grandmother.

Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BRIDGETJONES%3AMADABOUTTHEBOY.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=u4i%2Ff5pTLsJNA5InbP%2BRy82m74o90%2BhPg%2FRuKa%2FgFNtgEmxqdVokQ%2FjIp9GuclFH%2Fd9vdGE13Cva%2F2yQ8DT5pyGrGnkMdQB84i5GyocrggMS7aTFFNbRRVbd6Ubjmgk43eun3c7lWmDJbhgJ%2F4oD56ZAWVjbH8a9vvbj42X5fdvrmpZTRkYG%2B%2Bvr8NC08bMN4hQf4oV4jWh8EhuInnle1hhDFslA7UMlZ7z9%2BIYefc822KKva9e67ya9xh8GSmsy4Lkf5COX8h%2BRWtppxXnWmmFXdnNAd1yLnmXaZ5wX03tswvEYl0knK281%2F58JD7GMviumB23Q7rQRq8xYn%2FJqbQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-18T10:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.\n\nWhat led to that first ground-breaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874.

And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish.

Hooked on drugs and adrenaline; and struggling to resist the pull of his gang of fellow football fans, Jack is arrested after some violent matchday exploits and given six weeks to turn his life around, or else face a long spell in prison. Juggling his marriage, his mates, his hard-nut bully of a father-in-law and his wayward 25-year-old stepbrother, Jack tries to get his life back on-track but slowly his world starts to spiral out of control. There’s romance, there’s comedy, but this ain’t no ‘rom-com’…this is real life, on the line.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/MARCHINGPOWDER.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=PUz4e6XA55ZO76Pqi9oLjpeWnjIFwhmrt4Vwm9TCKpCP%2FItdBqrdU%2B7UElLBme1M%2Bt8Y%2FftNrl8LUMy%2FsjJ%2FsuaULEMcib5SK15RnM1zEWL2L%2Fu4mWsdlzBgLFg4j3HXTVGqbUV06hL%2FqaEAz%2B6b5PuPPFMZEwgpgz0wENoqKFll77Ib8s94kr08NXa5Hp%2FWJdubuONCJil%2FxvYc6Bgbbbc7ZVve%2BoyYGCCWelFC0hNn4MMAtnPt4ajIxuq2wV1Tm5JtwafWy2m0oxB4DJi6u86AQdT%2FoPglo6KnQya%2F68yBnnUoo%2FhYMUCZaqbXmJEHG88H94%2FsoAcuK9DfA01UNg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 07 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-07T15:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74782"},{"time":"2025-03-07T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290412&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-07T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74784"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-07T19:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147637"},{"time":"2025-03-07T20:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290413&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-07T20:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74787"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 08 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-08T15:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74792"},{"time":"2025-03-08T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290414&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-08T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74794"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-08T19:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147642"},{"time":"2025-03-08T20:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290415&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-08T20:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74797"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 09 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-09T15:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74802"},{"time":"2025-03-09T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290416&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-09T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74804"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-09T19:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147643"},{"time":"2025-03-09T20:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290417&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-03-09T20:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74807"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"MON 10 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-10T19:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147638"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 11 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-11T19:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147639"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 12 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-12T19:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147640"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 13 MAR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-03-13T19:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147641"}]}],"length_in_minutes":96},{"title":"MEMOIR OF A SNAIL","description":"Grace Pudel is a lonely misfit with an affinity for collecting ornamental snails and an intense love for books.

As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, Geoff grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SEPTEMBER5.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=KFQZzUFDcIkH%2BTtxrG%2BABQL3jIUSu2hZ47GeU6Nju2HAVE%2FWmlLs8mKzzBqwxmI2FCdDGrn1hhJSiv%2FEz1RKNFN2irq4WdxMhoHzmXEOJhNgaQzlumEYlW2bNzmNhccTSD1At%2FbBNjYfZiGlJ%2FcdHaA2%2Fy3PcLwcR1UlDOJVpqNLy%2FEm9bJw1FryW8DkghfWZ3zfSK8LLbVmLe%2B4%2BRosKPzgNIsPHTT4AmeI%2Bz8OabWo6xfFsVZ%2F0GBeBr3IbeajV4k4ODsCup2dpNTcFq4SAYG0flXiKIW2lRvwczzKca0bt9wnypV7PToGDzz%2BwzOYPws%2Bh63pldMJVyWZiSjFvw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-18T14:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290228&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-18T16:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/38607"},{"time":"2025-02-18T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290226&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-18T20:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290327&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-18T21:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74979"},{"time":"2025-02-18T21:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39051"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-18T22:20:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147590"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-19T14:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290229&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-19T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290227&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-19T18:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/38797"},{"time":"2025-02-19T20:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290328&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-19T21:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75006"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-19T22:20:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147591"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 20 FEB","screenings":[{"time":"2025-02-20T09:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39074"},{"time":"2025-02-20T11:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39059"},{"time":"2025-02-20T14:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290202&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-20T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290203&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39076"},{"time":"2025-02-20T20:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290329&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-02-20T21:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75018"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-20T22:20:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147592"}]}],"length_in_minutes":95},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n Watched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

Spoiler alert: He won’t.  \n\nFrom 87North—producers of the groundbreaking action films Nobody, Violent Night, Bullet Train, Atomic Blonde and The Fall Guy—comes a visceral, high-octane story of wrath and revenge.   \n\nQuan stars as Marvin Gable, a realtor working the Milwaukee suburbs, where ‘For Sale’ signs bloom.

And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. Meanwhile, in a dentist's office overlooking Sydney Harbor, Nemo has landed in a fish tank that is home to a colorful group of characters who want to initiate him into their gang. When word of Marlin and Dory's ocean adventures gets back to Nemo, he is so thrilled to learn of his father's search for him that he becomes motivated to move forward with a daring escape plan of his own.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FINDINGNEMO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ewufg0TXn7gAer18NxprLvDmO5%2BGP1N230Tx7%2FN2qtWPF65uZjw63HujzF80uupEtnaiWUGolWFPDDXNp9w71fQCj0tfAxS7TGmlaYQ6WL4haFFXpBPjRboeJg531rw0HXhCvdUchcvxwZsHRr6uAC%2F87y%2FoqP%2B%2FcYEnj7ARVPLo%2Fdldae1QAGRgOhk5ISkbF3V%2BleGsWO8vlcbfRwgny2baCoYHRIh8btJbYJnCRNnn73QF3lWmSG8nGisQINWMtHDaIECaFgtdFoGysyFSWv4I0huKRCOgZ0z7BUTTeeCueTjSAQmQwC9UY8uj2fhEs0VLo4%2BOgWnt9Cu5qopMPg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":101,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 22 FEB","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-02-22T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/146607"}]}]},{"title":"I'M STILL HERE","description":"BRAZIL, 1971.

Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish.
