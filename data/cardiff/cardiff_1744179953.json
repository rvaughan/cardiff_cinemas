The production showcases bespoke instruments, including a magnetic harp, a circular flute, an aluphone, and a reverb chamber, and Björk is furthermore joined on stage by musical director and multi-instrumentalist Bergur Þórisson, percussionist Manu Delago, flute septet Viibra, harpist Katie Buckley and the Hamrahlid choir. Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton-Jones.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BJ%C3%96RK%3ACORNUCOPIA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=uk23f%2FKtU2kDFftu9tL01hL1J%2BBDmugvxZ2w2MOj%2FETtyCqnZzKEUbEFQEMRTFxdamo%2BC8hr8qjgGa39f%2BK%2BfgAQUWa9gYWT%2BBtV25%2BvtjkgJaJny62SEk%2BIgOX4aO0yLOZyhiZJZ3gR8x1WJQ7o0mPkNeFFlX8Nd%2Bars4juDUmDPf9bKBR%2FRg9BFJP7IaFXlHWok3nA06L8VtWxUdXjcGVwFKuOafBnqHnd3kkTA6t%2BRXQwpVMgNZ0GyaIzrJO1SkdstaoCNradjlJZeuWSow418mbMEocQC0Rupxci%2BQ8k4TCImNYEiIMaHOMAYSxx3gIE%2B%2BgirJS%2BDFWDxNg85w%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED

DEATH","description":"The spectacular sculptures and paintings of Michelangelo seem so familiar to us, but what do we really know about this Renaissance giant? Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37640"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37639"}]}],"length_in_minutes":91},{"title":"FLOW","description":"Wunderkind director Gints Zilbalodis has taken the animation world by storm with his beautifully crafted sophomore feature Flow, which has received a multitude of awards and nominations to date, including two nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards.  \n\nThe mystical world he creates in Flow is in peril. There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-09T09:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists.

What does she want? When will she leave? Only The Woman in the Yard knows.\n\nFrom Blumhouse, the most successful global brand in horror, comes a new original chiller starring BAFTA and SAG nominee Danielle Deadwyler (Till, The Harder They Fall, The Piano Lesson) as Ramona, a woman crippled by grief after she survives a car accident that takes her husband (Russell Hornsby; BMF, Fences).\n\nSeriously injured, Ramona now must care for their 14-year-old son (Peyton Jackson; Respect, American Refugee) and 6-year-old-daughter (Estella Kahiha; Will Trent, BMF), alone in her rural farmhouse.\n\nThen one day the woman takes form in their yard.\n\nRamona assumes the woman (Okwui Okpokwasili; The Exorcist: Believer, Julie Taymor’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream) is lost or demented, but as the woman creeps nearer and nearer to the house, it becomes clear she is no ordinary figure and her intentions are anything but peaceful. Now Ramona must rally to protect herself and her children from the grasp of the woman who simply won’t leave them alone.\n\nThe Woman in the Yard is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Black Adam, Jungle Cruise), who recently directed Deadwyler in the upcoming action thriller Carry On. The film is written by first-time feature screenwriter Sam Stefanak.\n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum, producer of The Invisible Man and The Black Phone, along with acclaimed Emmy nominated producer Stephanie Allain p.g.a. (The Exorcist: Believer, Hustle & Flow), and is executive produced by star Danielle Deadwyler, Jaume Collet-Serra, James Moran and Gabrielle Ebron.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEWOMANINTHEYARD.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=xKomy6OBLjPXmQ54B2OvMFDTgFTS7NCkNcszjIwHTSJtTQ3GhpKgq5rAoiWZ6GY4HuclsMhmBOytSUQghfQFGVaMvGv2QhEBE6R0y4NN6oyyZC6jk2fCfT7pQuP%2FfppUbi7NHncqwgeAnwZQFyY5d3I%2FfT8ZclitzW77L%2BMXaNhF6SBPtygzRXTs0X3BD6JTUKVNWEh1NXeCjgZJern48kttyJPz3G3%2BkiX5B9tuQ0OwEzz4sne6zq5lo1C9Rt3GauD96XYjcjZVXsizuLeNSuFhIn0CGT4aXRRTafyhntIdfaD8rrOxzRsuyTa8oPePZyTmeEs9DMyx%2B6qg7mX0sA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-09T20:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293188&lang=en-GB"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-09T21:10:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/150937"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-10T20:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293198&lang=en-GB"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-10T21:10:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/150938"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 13 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-13T20:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151368"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 15 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-15T20:10:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151376"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 17 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-17T20:55:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151381"}]}],"length_in_minutes":88},{"title":"THOMAS & FRIENDS: JOURNEY BEYOND SODOR","description":"Let your little ones experience the magic of cinema with our mini-movies!\n\nThomas and his friends travel to the mainland to save James and show that friendship is more important than being the favourite engine.

A heavily muscled construction worker, he boasts a beautiful wife, Lori, good friends, and a technologically advanced home featuring video phones and even video walls. But he is haunted by dreams of a mysterious brunette woman and the red wastelands of Mars. Quaid visits Rekall, a unique travel agency that implants the memory of an adventure into its customers' minds, to get the chance to live out his Martian fantasies. When something goes terribly wrong and a blocked off portion of his mind is activated, Quaid finds himself at the center of a dangerous conspiracy. He must travel to Mars and get to the bottom of why he is being hunted by henchmen. But how can he know that what he's experiencing isn't just part of the Rekall experience? Are the mutant revolutionaries on Mars his allies, enemies, or complete fabrications? And is the lovely brunette at his side nothing more than a figment of his imagination?","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/TOTALRECALL.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=arA4k8WJe1kuaUiWMIFJKLi1kwVF0iylrRWHC4lx0loIgwDMg%2BJAPMML6rNedd01xAln9cvrrCyhNuSia8xE6zM7BP4l%2Bwxk1r8ek7%2BdHnCoDWlwtTOhFQfsnL03C1YRd2eoC1Ew3DCids2Ab12pOlsnIdeCOp7N%2FRXx7AhDO8iBz62yWIYSP4Q8OmZBkjyUHOx9oHE7kQcgA6giIWZXR4fesMA8TCjxp4RwH%2BrZC3AQm5MC7sLZDg1k54Vpp3uI7NSO7ustNSGoOsxYE2jtfG3Z80QJj3%2FdJEnCiBueCzV%2FRwMDccsDP3fgtCB8%2FQqSRW844J%2BUBgTxE59yTW6s8g%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":100,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-09T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77258"}]}]},{"title":"RESTLESS","description":"A middle-aged empty nester's mundane life is upended when raucous new neighbors move in next door, unleashing potential danger and disruption.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/RESTLESS.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=LsUhJaj3iUeMclSpfT5QPKjjEgC2gtnk7WGLFQNMZAR8h%2FfrbKOsT0HmxBOe8rGpuMwc2GTrMW%2B7GAM0dBEoP7rSo8pb%2Fo3jUihtwws5ByDc%2BpCDHb4fLT%2BiuJs5YieGXifmpU5T55tlwP%2B9ZKkLmBnNqBYg%2FVEXh2NVKxaTMKfhMoQAJBaihf3dgHFuduoKObLcsFqcFZjwa5Xmam%2Fs9uP31A2Xyu%2FnZqKC2IVbwzs5BiMMX9IjhdKukGs0SKTwwss5CAMyX2zmvEU1pB27CZRtwR02acNifUsysqL7zenHhajcGQgFx1yMfq3zQs8AOLVpw9%2B4Lnf3vx8abxREag%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":89,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-09T15:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293151&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-09T17:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293152&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-09T20:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293153&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SANTOSH","description":"A government scheme sees newly widowed Santosh inherit her husband’s job as a police constable in the rural badlands of Northern India.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":100,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-10T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77259"}]}]},{"title":"RESTLESS","description":"A middle-aged empty nester's mundane life is upended when raucous new neighbors move in next door, unleashing potential danger and disruption.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/RESTLESS.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=LsUhJaj3iUeMclSpfT5QPKjjEgC2gtnk7WGLFQNMZAR8h%2FfrbKOsT0HmxBOe8rGpuMwc2GTrMW%2B7GAM0dBEoP7rSo8pb%2Fo3jUihtwws5ByDc%2BpCDHb4fLT%2BiuJs5YieGXifmpU5T55tlwP%2B9ZKkLmBnNqBYg%2FVEXh2NVKxaTMKfhMoQAJBaihf3dgHFuduoKObLcsFqcFZjwa5Xmam%2Fs9uP31A2Xyu%2FnZqKC2IVbwzs5BiMMX9IjhdKukGs0SKTwwss5CAMyX2zmvEU1pB27CZRtwR02acNifUsysqL7zenHhajcGQgFx1yMfq3zQs8AOLVpw9%2B4Lnf3vx8abxREag%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":89,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-10T15:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293154&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-10T17:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293155&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-10T20:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293182&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIKANDAR","description":"Salman Khan (last seen in TIGER 3) & Rashmika Mandanna (last seen in PUSHPA 2) combine forces this Eid in an action thriller from the accomplished director of GHAJINI, A.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":104,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 11 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-11T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293680&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-11T14:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78222"},{"time":"2025-04-11T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78231"},{"time":"2025-04-11T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292054&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"PREDATOR","description":"Deep in the jungle, several bodies have been discovered skinned and hanging from trees, although who or what could have done this is a mystery.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 11 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-11T11:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78424"},{"time":"2025-04-11T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291260&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-11T13:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75994"},{"time":"2025-04-11T16:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75995"},{"time":"2025-04-11T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291261&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-11T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75996"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Originally recorded at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 11 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-11T10:45:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151206"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-11T13:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148479"},{"time":"2025-04-11T13:55:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020097/286770","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-11T15:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148480"},{"time":"2025-04-11T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39813"}]}]},{"title":"SYLVANIAN FAMILIES","description":"During the annual Festival of the Stars in Sylvanian Village.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":104,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 12 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-12T09:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293438&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-12T14:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78082"},{"time":"2025-04-12T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78079"},{"time":"2025-04-12T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292055&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"PREDATOR","description":"Deep in the jungle, several bodies have been discovered skinned and hanging from trees, although who or what could have done this is a mystery.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 12 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-12T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291262&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-12T13:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75997"},{"time":"2025-04-12T16:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75998"},{"time":"2025-04-12T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291263&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-12T19:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78425"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Originally recorded at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 12 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-12T10:45:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151207"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-12T13:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148481"},{"time":"2025-04-12T13:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39814"},{"time":"2025-04-12T14:55:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020097/286779","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-12T15:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148482"}]}]},{"title":"SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3","description":"Sonic the Hedgehog returns to the big screen this holiday season in his most thrilling adventure yet.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":104,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 13 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-13T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293682&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-13T14:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78125"},{"time":"2025-04-13T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78131"},{"time":"2025-04-13T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292056&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIKANDAR","description":"Salman Khan (last seen in TIGER 3) & Rashmika Mandanna (last seen in PUSHPA 2) combine forces this Eid in an action thriller from the accomplished director of GHAJINI, A.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":104,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 14 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-14T09:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293440&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-14T14:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78179"},{"time":"2025-04-14T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78186"},{"time":"2025-04-14T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293471&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"PREDATOR","description":"Deep in the jungle, several bodies have been discovered skinned and hanging from trees, although who or what could have done this is a mystery.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 14 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-14T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291266&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-14T15:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78201"},{"time":"2025-04-14T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291267&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-14T18:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78202"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Originally recorded at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 14 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-14T10:45:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151209"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-14T13:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148485"},{"time":"2025-04-14T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020097/286909","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-14T15:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148486"},{"time":"2025-04-14T18:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40517"}]}]},{"title":"SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3","description":"Sonic the Hedgehog returns to the big screen this holiday season in his most thrilling adventure yet.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":104,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 15 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-15T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293684&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-15T14:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78288"},{"time":"2025-04-15T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78301"},{"time":"2025-04-15T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293472&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIKANDAR","description":"Salman Khan (last seen in TIGER 3) & Rashmika Mandanna (last seen in PUSHPA 2) combine forces this Eid in an action thriller from the accomplished director of GHAJINI, A.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":104,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 17 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-17T09:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293686&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-17T14:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78403"},{"time":"2025-04-17T16:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=293782&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-17T16:50:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78414"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 17 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-17T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291272&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-17T16:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-78413"},{"time":"2025-04-17T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291273&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Originally recorded at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 17 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-17T10:45:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/151212"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-17T13:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148491"},{"time":"2025-04-17T14:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020097/286818","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-17T15:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148492"}]}]},{"title":"SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3","description":"Sonic the Hedgehog returns to the big screen this holiday season in his most thrilling adventure yet.

A heavily muscled construction worker, he boasts a beautiful wife, Lori, good friends, and a technologically advanced home featuring video phones and even video walls. But he is haunted by dreams of a mysterious brunette woman and the red wastelands of Mars. Quaid visits Rekall, a unique travel agency that implants the memory of an adventure into its customers' minds, to get the chance to live out his Martian fantasies. When something goes terribly wrong and a blocked off portion of his mind is activated, Quaid finds himself at the center of a dangerous conspiracy.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles.

A heavily muscled construction worker, he boasts a beautiful wife, Lori, good friends, and a technologically advanced home featuring video phones and even video walls. But he is haunted by dreams of a mysterious brunette woman and the red wastelands of Mars. Quaid visits Rekall, a unique travel agency that implants the memory of an adventure into its customers' minds, to get the chance to live out his Martian fantasies.

Set in the hauntingly beautiful ruins of the ancient Roman Amphitheater in Pompeii, Italy, the film captures Pink Floyd performing an intimate concert without an audience. Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. This meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release.

The production showcases bespoke instruments, including a magnetic harp, a circular flute, an aluphone, and a reverb chamber, and Björk is furthermore joined on stage by musical director and multi-instrumentalist Bergur Þórisson, percussionist Manu Delago, flute septet Viibra, harpist Katie Buckley and the Hamrahlid choir. Digitally animated moving curtains create a modern lanterna magica for live music, transforming 21st-century VR visuals into the grandeur of a 19th-century theatre — and now into an immersive cinema experience, enhanced by meticulously crafted Dolby Atmos spatial audio.\n\nDirected by Ísold Uggadóttir, the film features sound and visual creative direction, music arrangements, production, and performance by Björk. It showcases the work of James Merry as co-creative director of visuals, and original animation by Tobias Gremmler – with additional contributions from Andrew Thomas Huang, Gabríela Friðriksdóttir, Pierre-Alain Giraud, Nick Knight, and Warren Du Preez & Nick Thornton-Jones.","rating":null,"image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BJ%C3%96RK%3ACORNUCOPIA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=uk23f%2FKtU2kDFftu9tL01hL1J%2BBDmugvxZ2w2MOj%2FETtyCqnZzKEUbEFQEMRTFxdamo%2BC8hr8qjgGa39f%2BK%2BfgAQUWa9gYWT%2BBtV25%2BvtjkgJaJny62SEk%2BIgOX4aO0yLOZyhiZJZ3gR8x1WJQ7o0mPkNeFFlX8Nd%2Bars4juDUmDPf9bKBR%2FRg9BFJP7IaFXlHWok3nA06L8VtWxUdXjcGVwFKuOafBnqHnd3kkTA6t%2BRXQwpVMgNZ0GyaIzrJO1SkdstaoCNradjlJZeuWSow418mbMEocQC0Rupxci%2BQ8k4TCImNYEiIMaHOMAYSxx3gIE%2B%2BgirJS%2BDFWDxNg85w%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":120,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 07 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-07T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40397"},{"time":"2025-05-07T18:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40201"}]}]},{"title":"BLUEY AT THE CINEMA: LET’S PLAY CHEF COLLECTION","description":"Bluey at the Cinema: Let’s Play Chef Collection is an hour-long treat for fans of Bluey to enjoy, made up of eight episodes from the TV show’s three series, all based around the fun of food!
