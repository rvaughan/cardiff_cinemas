It’s been almost three decades since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory, and now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/28YEARSLATER.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=B5p332KRe4iK3BixTIZkz3d4F65pjmYYMgcWQYRUFH5rwM2CwhN1%2BKnMXVfRKii5%2Bv446T2dbC85xdjtHl%2F5H7inDrFZZVmIaQtPHHKefe0gr6mhMxxcoiuFUSiCTFKDDC6j%2FBdA6u1iL1kXh3SC2YW%2Blpn7TQtVFKf72TvsKt2dXLxrWry0qAfPnTaVlKgsDV7rLGmT2bTsq6V5YyUm8mQ7wGy%2FUCykb9SIxtigxXqvS9C4NtMsJ6jyRIFRcUzzzz0oBWQuJ6fZJwlUl5oqaP6Nkbq4r0ceB9pIG0R3LoOPiw%2Btwma1RX62nCTt8CCfcZwIhKLoVkoB10IFWdGxUg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BRIDGETJONESMADABOUTTHEBOY.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ehchoTFxfPXpKPwfnifxousXjNF2aW6I0DPZFtaQKALtvFur5G0Yn3uO%2BZ6kEKqyH01e9eY86TB4k0omo1NY%2BsC4%2FU33%2FuKBYSAhIdHxHufSR36E7l9W08S8t1yLcW1ptcl6%2BTbOnIV%2FWflCiHuMcfVz%2B0%2Bu5ZtgpPbMfUhN7ZMW1mBYjZwNM3881Y9Ddeg6jmcuMH4jIT73Ta5hRhihDh%2BwG%2B6oTS8M%2BzWhUW3iu7ODgQpP4zUOtNjRgHu%2B1uSoBNDH%2BLB%2FQ%2FLf4As5fzARcSDyegv11DFcjnpR4%2FDpOD5OvGvUO5X88gIIrom3Zxu2NcDsDXyT769KYBRc9aYloQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-03T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-81335"}]}],"length_in_minutes":125},{"title":"CLOWN IN A CORNFIELD","description":"In a fading Midwestern town, the local legend of Frendo the clown becomes all too real as teenagers start to go missing one by one, before meeting spectacularly sticky ends.

MOVIE","description":"Dubbed “the greatest that never was,” Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) was FORMULA 1’s most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career.  Thirty years later, he’s a nomadic racer-for-hire when he’s approached by his former teammate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), owner of a struggling FORMULA 1 team that is on the verge of collapse.  Ruben convinces Sonny to come back to FORMULA 1 for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world.  He’ll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace.  But as the engines roar, Sonny’s past catches up with him and he finds that in FORMULA 1, your teammate is your fiercest competition—and the road to redemption is not something you can travel alone.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/F1THEMOVIE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=Puo%2BfrCkLKu%2B%2Fy2cm2fAhpSMgy725%2BY%2FT1DLH2OrAW7klnoJyVGaV%2BPGlaeBTXDcyiGGCSTZBMXWELaUJPMxmZPdux%2FPDAtY20KE%2FzxjesFASiKW16ftZHpdeKadHjHu0CFe%2BKJhLAGOp7L4JR7T%2BXWcSWdfzUKaDH%2FlMYzu0nrXXCrQxlPUbP9%2FRwJ%2BYjczVpUqRRA5hQ%2Buujgf4JnooAIQn8vPSg2iwyn4PBWgXJv3tHX2%2B67%2FKbi8HmaGRkLNY8BpJjrKYnYNYOapZ%2BQcNpEqe9d%2Fe1W2gx2eylQi80%2BFSk2zbgGf9zMOW3vnJEJ0JkuRbRHrlf92Q2WQGk19%2FQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED

June 13th of 1958, two Camp Crystal Lake counselors, Claudette and Barry, slip away from the campfire for an illicit rendezvous. They are discovered and murdered by an unseen assailant. Two decades later, the camp is preparing to reopen. The town loony, Crazy Ralph, warns camp cook Annie that \"Camp Blood\" has a death curse, but Annie continues to hitch her way to camp. Local truck driver Enos tells her the camp lore: the murders in '58, a boy drowning in '57, the fires and bad water that thwarted attempts to reopen the camp. Annie then catches a ride with the wrong person, who chases her through the woods and slits her throat. Alice is left alone against Pamela, whose son Jason drowned at Camp Crystal Lake in 1957. Now all the counselors of the camp must die, and it is one or the other in a match to the death.Who will survive the long night at Camp Blood?","rating":"18","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FRIDAYTHE13TH.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=t471Lik2u18%2FN8hEW1QGqy92M8CDglpuZUeQNTd9sAr4hDoFSfgbRELhUChvUIfHKiqK%2FsuSXljYYTAvqEWmnpF6%2BXwlAm2NvZrKs9rTma3jgyBSJOwdZgw32Ij9yBhBfJZp%2BSx4UUbur79Myj2BntriyQYfg6oTUE85R7lRAMGeBxV5e%2FWhU1Mk6RqpFqt9ezakeDzCd38vUbOT0KHPelfer4i4ZGYN2w4issbZL6x85Y7n%2FO7wMsQ6zLgx49ey9Lkj%2BidxrtSGTsUWaRiT%2FSSLSag0MzbvEZckU%2BHJZk4MlqSyUnyUeHeHvFnR8vo8Io9ypEc0Esy%2F23ArgY7ENA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 13 JUN","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-06-13T18:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/154397"}]}],"length_in_minutes":96},{"title":"FROM THE WORLD OF JOHN WICK: BALLERINA","description":"The world of John Wick expands in Ballerina, where Ana de Armas stars as an assassin trained in the deadly traditions of the Ruska Roma, on a mission for revenge after her father’s death.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FROMTHEWORLDOFJOHNWICKBALLERINA.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=b%2FOuHRNPPRihwO9j8GWEqT86%2BLtgrrVxXppLdWXrcRxrV8XDi0t7ZVw8909UDhMj1NdGIoIf%2BPjq3LXtEPmuXdOe5due9U3rtLdEyioVnhK3xy5M1qcNi%2BiottylUhsGzLTaddv1ZPJfQdpgfsYoePNSgDW0ZTzCTJJwT0WzrUQGSSi52dZ5lnc%2BsDMrqWKL0ql9ad7NXwFRh7XzQvVQtzpJs1TOmZ4jFRV2ObXtVcmQCzKBPhrWjxInH9gfbmP4ACmSS7JIgln0jPTViw8DMES3Y1RJvq6BES%2F7%2FahW9RC77K7lprqk7IEWAmqUuXwsjGWL%2B35JgQmQZOmi%2FvSU0w%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 06 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-06T16:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41915"},{"time":"2025-06-06T19:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41522"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 07 JUN","screenings":[{"time":"2025-06-07T19:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/41523"}]}],"length_in_minutes":125},{"title":"GARDUTĖ - TASTY","description":"The first-ever Lithuanian culinary comedy, TASTY, is a hilarious story about two friends and their adventure on a high-end food production reality TV show.\n\nEnthusiastic village girl Saulė (A.

Harry's relatives have just as reluctantly learned to live with the unwelcome presence of their orphaned relation, a constant reminder of Petunia's \"wayward\" sister and brother-in-law and their mysterious and untimely demise. Even the impending arrival of his 11th birthday offers no excitement for Harry- as usual, there's little chance of cards, presents or any kind of birthday treat. This year, however, is different. On his 11th birthday, Harry learns that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. Invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime.

On the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. With the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. As an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader.","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/HOWTOTRAINYOURDRAGON.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=iU1Kyq1jvFhDGK%2BUtvM47e7Cn%2FUd%2F6mjYYme1heGy3eipgjIag%2FYYPyAUXi5Xkpmme36Dk%2BPa0UuZvX1AVm%2BsWF7y1%2FUDL8shTbjeLrkNh8lh%2BPVLXkvDEm7d5Of0arw5uYXCuEd0%2BKjaaxfkAenPVni0pwIGGRoCO5yMCXbwAW9HxGBFzMIESV1houz0js10nvEtC6iPdeTvyQN%2Fv9Lr8SyXx8pyD1JvGmFEA2it7OkIjkQ3wIIbOVRr2Dn5p9CgE1L8OhpUKKR4a6XpyI69WutY2xsTA3viA155GCm02ZDNUL7j1uaRu9E%2F5jsqU3I%2BhQZPxvPnmK4o5VKV4wirQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON

Tenor Xabier Anduaga returns after his acclaimed 2023 Met debut in L’Elisir d’Amore, co-starring as Amina’s fiancé Elvino, alongside soprano Sydney Mancasola as her rival, Lisa, and bass Alexander Vinogradov as Count Rodolfo.

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH

In his new production, Rolando Villazón—the tenor who has embarked on a brilliant second career as a director—retains the opera’s original setting in the Swiss Alps but uses its somnambulant plot to explore the emotional and psychological valleys of the mind. Tenor Xabier Anduaga returns after his acclaimed 2023 Met debut in L’Elisir d’Amore, co-starring as Amina’s fiancé Elvino, alongside soprano Sydney Mancasola as her rival, Lisa, and bass Alexander Vinogradov as Count Rodolfo. Riccardo Frizza takes the podium for one of opera’s most ravishing works.
