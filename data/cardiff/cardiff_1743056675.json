SCREENING","description":"This preview screening of The Minecraft Movie is very special, as Odeon Cinemas and Warner Brothers Distribution are generously donating all the ticket money to support the work of MediCinema.\n \nMediCinema builds and runs cinemas inside hospitals, that reduce patient anxiety, stress and loneliness and support patients at times when it’s hard to cope.\nMediCinemas screen all the latest films free of charge for patients, and are specially designed to accommodate beds, wheelchairs and medical equipment and staffed with nurses and volunteers. Four misfits — Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Jack Black).","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/AMINECRAFTMOVIE%3AMEDICINEMACHARITYSCREENING.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=DXIKtyTHj67RPk%2F5vfSi4XuCKQJ0HLktTjnY1Hv1%2F%2FBwZQSBaGCEdkRZAravF4zYETsXBpvYGcwic1t0B8tWTnRmbPPVqY%2B76NlYNXk8khwYbcXdr7YA%2BBuFULrzNjIj%2FHtnN49o9D41ROmDci1jQ6B5AjOqFBN0NVdWS1f90kTzVDZ9OPP2SyXeglpmMdu%2Fh%2BkPEheXFsUnNzerWy1na9Tbw%2BvKFgiAH%2BGKAG2tIfpiXsZGt94wO1KH3J5my5a71Nl5M1w%2FQLnb5duq3%2FnG9r1xzLsZo8ZC1B5E%2BI9udrDKNSRPfDsrjb%2FlRrxFy%2F4xe7UL6APt%2F4DlhYglgcYDiA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 03 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-03T18:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-76770"}]}],"length_in_minutes":101},{"title":"A REAL PAIN","description":"Mismatched cousins David and Benji reunite for a tour through Poland to honor their beloved grandmother.

As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy (Academy Award® winner COLIN FIRTH) and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.\n\nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 10-year-old Billy (CASPER KNOPF, Halo) and 6-year-old Mabel (newcomer MILA JANKOVIC), and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends, including her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (HUGH GRANT).\n","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/BRIDGETJONES%3AMADABOUTTHEBOY.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=u4i%2Ff5pTLsJNA5InbP%2BRy82m74o90%2BhPg%2FRuKa%2FgFNtgEmxqdVokQ%2FjIp9GuclFH%2Fd9vdGE13Cva%2F2yQ8DT5pyGrGnkMdQB84i5GyocrggMS7aTFFNbRRVbd6Ubjmgk43eun3c7lWmDJbhgJ%2F4oD56ZAWVjbH8a9vvbj42X5fdvrmpZTRkYG%2B%2Bvr8NC08bMN4hQf4oV4jWh8EhuInnle1hhDFslA7UMlZ7z9%2BIYefc822KKva9e67ya9xh8GSmsy4Lkf5COX8h%2BRWtppxXnWmmFXdnNAd1yLnmXaZ5wX03tswvEYl0knK281%2F58JD7GMviumB23Q7rQRq8xYn%2FJqbQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-27T11:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman

one of the world’s most secretive and ancient events – selecting the new Pope.\n\nAfter the unexpected death of the Pope, Cardinal-Dean Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) is forced to put aside any grief and is tasked with putting together a conclave and running the covert process of selecting a new Pope. Cardinal Lawrence (Fiennes) gathers the Catholic Church’s most powerful leaders from around the world, including the US candidate Bellini (Stanley Tucci), Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto), a more traditional Italian. A more powerful American, Tremblay (John Lithgow), the increasingly popular Nigerian Adeyemi (Lucian Msamati) and the mysterious contender Benitez (Carlos Diehz), who has been working in Kabul. \n\nHowever, once they are all locked together in the halls of the Vatican, Lawrence (Fiennes) uncovers a trail of deep secrets which could shake the foundations of the Roman Catholic Church. Conclave stars Ralph Fiennes, Isabella Rossellini, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, and Sergio Castellitto.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/CONCLAVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=jVHxzlP8a7Uyh%2F7e%2FfRWTP4GyTd7Xd%2BQdhsDpgSjk%2B%2BxUZ2hHCWTmJM4Dt7ZJHabnAbKZU0FyvullH7rSiMrkEoXT4tZdVNfSpyxdNAwqaoNRyAEiV3XEQAatzI0LFTI48m%2FJuY1yuGIP5FNYLNv3PgoGGangjHA8Myesx4dUavPW3o4E4cDgNt7BXLf3vsa%2FSrae%2FV5SkveWPfAZGaUZKzwCwfxp7vY2FK%2BSGZbAoWrGiNVDqpMAVI9cr2PhQuJMkSYoG5SG3DkOSd4NSIhs%2FX7eBysPaP3IfbNaEUJEy1KIe4T64hEZj%2BjiXK5R99uWS8WAeiNSmCB54LjbG43lQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-27T10:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39984"},{"time":"2025-03-27T15:40:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39974"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TOMORROW","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-28T10:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40000"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"MON 31 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-31T14:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40112"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 01 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-01T10:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40121"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 02 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-02T11:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40144"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 03 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-03T11:10:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77646"},{"time":"2025-04-03T15:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/40165"}]}],"length_in_minutes":120},{"title":"COURT - STATE VS.

Drop is jointly produced by blockbuster genre houses Blumhouse and Platinum Dunes.\n\nEmmy nominee Meghann Fahy, breakout star of White Lotus and The Perfect Couple, plays Violet, a widowed mother on her first date in years, who arrives at an upscale restaurant where she is relieved that her date, Henry (It Ends with Us’ Brandon Sklenar) is more charming and handsome than she expected. But their chemistry begins to curdle as Violet begins being irritated and then terrorized by a series of anonymous drops to her phone.\n\nShe is instructed to tell nobody and follow instructions or the hooded figure she sees on her home security cameras will kill Violet’s young son and babysitting sister. Violet must do exactly as directed or everyone she loves will die. Her unseen tormentor’s final directive?

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37640"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37639"}]}],"length_in_minutes":91},{"title":"FLOW","description":"Wunderkind director Gints Zilbalodis has taken the animation world by storm with his beautifully crafted sophomore feature Flow, which has received a multitude of awards and nominations to date, including two nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards.  \n\nThe mystical world he creates in Flow is in peril. There are traces of human inhabitants, but they are now nowhere to be seen as water begins to flood the landscape. The story begins following a small, solitary cat as the shoreline rises and the home where it once lived is submerged underwater. Forced to flee, he happens upon a refuge boat containing a calm and unperturbed Cabybarre who seems amenable to his presence, and the two begin a journey on the water towards higher ground. Along the way they cross paths with a lemur, obsessed with collecting shiny objects, a boisterous and excitable dog and a stoic, mysterious secretary bird. Together, as they traverse the landscape on their fable-like quest, the ragtag team of animals must learn to trust each other and work together to survive. \n\nFlow pushes the boundaries of animation, immersing audiences in a world before unseen.","rating":"U","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/FLOW.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=k9Nvn305WCnHPbpLJ13oPdv1tJJi41OgwVJaFAfiVMTkHqM3iLjddYhqS2eJYdlWVEzxZKv15TBhvmuA7DUf%2BQudVLml7DeXI3odbOSfINShhHulAWYGyiIvJDIsZSolcilAPNzqKuhSQtF4Ldlg9x72Yqg276i51R3etyRdQxrS0LIRCL5JUPAvYxVPsVgrO0firO8nlvOB6s19%2B1W05ZwCH6ZTzKrmqcyifa4uOK4NcYcCNSgp5L6hAsaouSQ21Nf8cYWIxUzy7bi4vghwMmb5IAb3E3Pvhbe9iCdsM7QI4Xn7ecpf3RsdTOWpDTbofGaIfMwPA%2BlXX541rdI47w%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TODAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-27T13:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld

Hooked on drugs and adrenaline; and struggling to resist the pull of his gang of fellow football fans, Jack is arrested after some violent matchday exploits and given six weeks to turn his life around, or else face a long spell in prison. Juggling his marriage, his mates, his hard-nut bully of a father-in-law and his wayward 25-year-old stepbrother, Jack tries to get his life back on-track but slowly his world starts to spiral out of control.

Neil Young in this personal, behind-the-scenes doc as he cruises the coast on his recent solo tour. Directed by acclaimed filmmaker and Young’s wife, Daryl Hannah, Coastal offers a glimpse behind the curtain of this unguarded iconoclast, as he navigates a return to the stage post-Covid - from his everyday observations on the bus to his candid, wry banter with his audience.\n\nThe illuminating film also features songs rarely, if ever played live, performed in breathtakingly beautiful

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons.

Set in the hauntingly beautiful ruins of the ancient Roman Amphitheater in Pompeii, Italy, the film captures Pink Floyd performing an intimate concert without an audience.\n\nFilmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience.\n\nAdditionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. This meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos.\n\nThese upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release.

irresistible soundtrack. Fresh from their arranged marriage, Uma moves into her husband’s cramped one-room home in Mumbai. It is an awkward start; she’s not the domestic wife he might have hoped for, while he is meek and more interested in boozing than engaging with her. Disillusioned with her new life, Uma finds independence by venturing out into the city. \n\nHowever, she starts to experience symptoms of a mysterious feral illness that she cannot shake off. Kandhari’s vibrant and ornate symmetrical compositions have attracted comparisons to Wes Anderson, yet Sister Midnight is cool original. It operates on its own frequency, thrillingly rebelling against convention, much like its heroine Uma – portrayed by the terrific Radhika Apte, who combines charm with a gift for physical comedy.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SISTERMIDNIGHT.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=gKDbnx%2Bv80w5vSwXoLeIecsuor1oKrs2mTLp4AKEOGyUJoLI9FlCU1OrLergJYxRHCJK8xqACArzbnuaAo5oTJaoK8SsNDfAUv4X8bhwXnWPvZEgQJ%2FcySTQU%2B5JlI10DM26WXR4nSBpzGTeO3tKH4Cz3crd2lP9%2ButG1YEEWGgs1q58Eg9pU%2Bdaws6%2B13Hp6BOwXvK4ns3MCzL25grryHglDa5QjuuDP%2BxWluuat8Lwxvinek7Bc2z1zRvTYp1HgWOtAdvSeKADNfoPeWAh0VKWWREL31kcB6cKjM58LGrgCO7T3KnETeSyJZSpf9qt%2FHO2vYheK%2B8DxWIVVQhGMQ%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 31 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-31T11:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39865"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"WED 02 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-02T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39866"}]}],"length_in_minutes":107},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n Watched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles.

Moss, the pop-inspired musical brings the queens - Catherine of Aragon (Jarnéia Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (Millie O'Connell), Jane Seymour (Natalie Paris), Anne of Cleves (Alexia McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Aimie Atkinson), and Catherine Parr (Maiya Quansah-Breed) — right into the 21st century with infectious, empowering performances, accompanied by the on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN

Odysseus has also changed—scarred by his experience of the Trojan war, he is no longer the mighty warrior from years past— but he must rediscover his strength in order to win back all that he has lost.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THERETURN.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=nIftRIGLglbCCDV2QGhmIrV3OaBmucNKcpGy3Iqm0%2FDniN1h%2BZnLMs5FZefAeGfpkgGQ%2F8KQ%2Fn8u3QYv%2BYj1VrgpLW%2BlyWvF4AnzCjL49FDbEguK4rrG3l%2F40vgCBY%2FOtkzgdpQhvJDTK4mPanOzeIwS5yrVHzLt9lfAEM9q0h9jJae9Nc%2FBiCD64lGIt0utyQd4LdJnRtmK62Q%2BDPYH6k0j1da%2BgYbDsSmDXIS9RHZ02aw98JPMmAbXoWYgee8I%2FEDUqAQiZQ%2FiI%2FlclogBWt9chJuFYTZ9w6OaYnwubec8nc9WXWZx5qt64Lh0OasPW%2F6VwIdK3CuhIfh8f%2Bk8Ww%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 09 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-09T17:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/149457"}]}],"length_in_minutes":0},{"title":"THE RETURN - LIVE WITH RALPH FIENNES","description":"Join us for a special preview of The Return on 9 April, followed by a discussion, broadcast live from the British Museum, with Academy Award nominee Ralph Fiennes, director Uberto Pasolini, British Museum's Keeper of Greece and Rome, Tom Harrison and Curator: Reception of the Ancient Mediterranean, Vicky Donnellan.\r\n\r\nThere will be no adverts or trailers for this screening.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THERETURN-LIVEWITHRALPHFIENNES.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=rsVtIZUjUJvrHNC09wjKnwv3ftiJlvjXU5tkCOtYxsrS0IBVQC%2BoBUPkxBmCt8N9xZOb7wRVpJO06%2FvQ4JpPeCrQ6xFAqNhPHT99leaCaa%2F9J5cN8nXDhdnqZvUQbFvkAVDek79sWKlAEmj5o5Q3axPQ%2FFhScKTeDGJ8cLuzYnjQkatoOeFNMJQb8M4iIgMgydCDhkSLGBJq4fXIUZ1siZ2GgT%2BZN6GBMmRpSH1XIRN7QdiqRZa0XAp7PB8ZJRZRFzr%2BY%2BM0deuRxjTqmxqy8%2BmOP936184KeDmRsjIUPPCH0vIWAC3Fi82qAvA9AEXH6A%2FjAvoxOpSkSasO%2FoanfA%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 09 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-09T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-76926"}]}],"length_in_minutes":161},{"title":"THE ROCK","description":"A mild-mannered chemist and an ex-con must lead the counterstrike when a rogue group of military men, led by a renegade general, threaten a nerve gas attack from Alcatraz","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEROCK.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=NjLtNf92l55j%2BEaIe2pTvzqXSya%2FNPAZPxK56wf1eqef3IBN5zeZk5T8VoFZdwX9gmhzR8Ckab4ohFz9VrtMFhTkoODDGPMQfTim0BWgpiR3WPG9hqfCEeFOzv0OQYShW%2BFV%2BgIyU9cKkv5C6VKiUtOceeyt9EvkiW4uZZK1iYyjtg8A8iPHSXh5J9nTtt6cJCTkxl269lHN%2BQSo%2FFTVXFjXXNU7R98Cjc4BnGo6k6FECnmpsv4JDGnckTrezCfgp4%2B2oZltffXy128z9JrV91fAoVfI8lcPaLqnfifCQ0HiTjlz%2FvJtqWo%2B6CKYkcOVEo8Xsm7vgJHypfThXEuwVw%3D%3D","screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 29 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-29T20:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020133/286079","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]},{"screenings_date_label":"MON 31 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-31T17:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020133/285062","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}],"length_in_minutes":136},{"title":"THE ROYAL BALLET: BALLET TO BROADWAY: WHEELDON WORKS","description":"Sensuous contemporary ballet meets the energy of musical theatre in four distinctive short works.

What does she want? When will she leave? Only The Woman in the Yard knows.\n\nFrom Blumhouse, the most successful global brand in horror, comes a new original chiller starring BAFTA and SAG nominee Danielle Deadwyler (Till, The Harder They Fall, The Piano Lesson) as Ramona, a woman crippled by grief after she survives a car accident that takes her husband (Russell Hornsby; BMF, Fences).\n\nSeriously injured, Ramona now must care for their 14-year-old son (Peyton Jackson; Respect, American Refugee) and 6-year-old-daughter (Estella Kahiha; Will Trent, BMF), alone in her rural farmhouse.\n\nThen one day the woman takes form in their yard.\n\nRamona assumes the woman (Okwui Okpokwasili; The Exorcist: Believer, Julie Taymor’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream) is lost or demented, but as the woman creeps nearer and nearer to the house, it becomes clear she is no ordinary figure and her intentions are anything but peaceful. Now Ramona must rally to protect herself and her children from the grasp of the woman who simply won’t leave them alone.\n\nThe Woman in the Yard is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Black Adam, Jungle Cruise), who recently directed Deadwyler in the upcoming action thriller Carry On.

Fresh from their arranged marriage, Uma moves into her husband’s cramped one-room home in Mumbai. It is an awkward start; she’s not the domestic wife he might have hoped for, while he is meek and more interested in boozing than engaging with her. Disillusioned with her new life, Uma finds independence by venturing out into the city. \n\nHowever, she starts to experience symptoms of a mysterious feral illness that she cannot shake off. Kandhari’s vibrant and ornate symmetrical compositions have attracted comparisons to Wes Anderson, yet Sister Midnight is cool original. It operates on its own frequency, thrillingly rebelling against convention, much like its heroine Uma – portrayed by the terrific Radhika Apte, who combines charm with a gift for physical comedy.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SISTERMIDNIGHT.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=gKDbnx%2Bv80w5vSwXoLeIecsuor1oKrs2mTLp4AKEOGyUJoLI9FlCU1OrLergJYxRHCJK8xqACArzbnuaAo5oTJaoK8SsNDfAUv4X8bhwXnWPvZEgQJ%2FcySTQU%2B5JlI10DM26WXR4nSBpzGTeO3tKH4Cz3crd2lP9%2ButG1YEEWGgs1q58Eg9pU%2Bdaws6%2B13Hp6BOwXvK4ns3MCzL25grryHglDa5QjuuDP%2BxWluuat8Lwxvinek7Bc2z1zRvTYp1HgWOtAdvSeKADNfoPeWAh0VKWWREL31kcB6cKjM58LGrgCO7T3KnETeSyJZSpf9qt%2FHO2vYheK%2B8DxWIVVQhGMQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":107,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"MON 31 MAR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-03-31T11:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39865"}]}]},{"title":"THE ALTO KNIGHTS","description":"From Warner Bros.

Fresh from their arranged marriage, Uma moves into her husband’s cramped one-room home in Mumbai. It is an awkward start; she’s not the domestic wife he might have hoped for, while he is meek and more interested in boozing than engaging with her. Disillusioned with her new life, Uma finds independence by venturing out into the city. \n\nHowever, she starts to experience symptoms of a mysterious feral illness that she cannot shake off. Kandhari’s vibrant and ornate symmetrical compositions have attracted comparisons to Wes Anderson, yet Sister Midnight is cool original. It operates on its own frequency, thrillingly rebelling against convention, much like its heroine Uma – portrayed by the terrific Radhika Apte, who combines charm with a gift for physical comedy.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SISTERMIDNIGHT.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=gKDbnx%2Bv80w5vSwXoLeIecsuor1oKrs2mTLp4AKEOGyUJoLI9FlCU1OrLergJYxRHCJK8xqACArzbnuaAo5oTJaoK8SsNDfAUv4X8bhwXnWPvZEgQJ%2FcySTQU%2B5JlI10DM26WXR4nSBpzGTeO3tKH4Cz3crd2lP9%2ButG1YEEWGgs1q58Eg9pU%2Bdaws6%2B13Hp6BOwXvK4ns3MCzL25grryHglDa5QjuuDP%2BxWluuat8Lwxvinek7Bc2z1zRvTYp1HgWOtAdvSeKADNfoPeWAh0VKWWREL31kcB6cKjM58LGrgCO7T3KnETeSyJZSpf9qt%2FHO2vYheK%2B8DxWIVVQhGMQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":107,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 02 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-02T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39866"}]}]},{"title":"TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY","description":"A cyborg, identical to the one who failed to kill Sarah Connor, must now protect her teenage son, John Connor, from a more advanced and powerful cyborg.","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/TERMINATOR2%3AJUDGEMENTDAY.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=ddyyLTSZfLEznG0ApKdaqvBc6N5J4d78qjDqUJy2Snv7y8yn%2BYZ1XMyh04RsJsvAeW8eIqNZhzyZw7tUQM2BjiY3GbwN4slalfGXb1mkP5EfoTKwa2Icm0SccgPGlw0u2A6SBGjRHbNw%2BW0%2FbKTIvQ1qCagymOymkagDFfTznb%2FXhmoq3EMVULTpXAyoT3mm0vALDQ9MAlnvJOPS89k5uIIj7gI0klc7qwsbRzA%2F1kDTQOB5Q219RgB8Hvz%2FmygGwLncWju8LaBb3Cj024%2BaUXQO3N%2B8hZzLYikzSPbISohpmihe2b1959BSjGe72KCtpVCkruP3yR6pguoqzNpeiw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":137,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 02 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-02T18:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020125/285919","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}]},{"title":"THE ALTO KNIGHTS","description":"From Warner Bros.

Megan run a vintage shop in Muswell Hill.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 06 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-06T10:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290873&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-06T10:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77333"},{"time":"2025-04-06T13:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290115&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-06T13:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74778"},{"time":"2025-04-06T14:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77334"},{"time":"2025-04-06T15:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290395&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-06T15:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75100"},{"time":"2025-04-06T16:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77358"},{"time":"2025-04-06T18:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=290870&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-06T18:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-74777"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 06 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-06T10:30:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147665"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-06T12:45:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147384"},{"time":"2025-04-06T13:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020097/284596","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-06T15:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147385"},{"time":"2025-04-06T16:15:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39109"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-06T17:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147386"},{"time":"2025-04-06T17:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020097/284598","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"},{"time":"2025-04-06T18:45:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/39176"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-06T19:35:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/147666"}]}]},{"title":"SYLVANIAN FAMILIES","description":"During the annual Festival of the Stars in Sylvanian Village.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":100,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"WED 09 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-09T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77258"}]}]},{"title":"SANTOSH","description":"A government scheme sees newly widowed Santosh inherit her husband’s job as a police constable in the rural badlands of Northern India.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":100,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 10 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-10T18:20:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-77259"}]}]},{"title":"THE CHOSEN: LAST SUPPER","description":"","rating":"15","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THECHOSEN%3ALASTSUPPER.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=vGhwivDFJ0eEGVdPX%2BTXnlvPsxGsQqx1vMsVhhoCke7koa1cEO8I056qsqmgcwBdXwRg8oPc4cheZE3XEAYcWH5wdgqY0YY0T9jFxY7zfaK%2FSJjrSzTVbEH%2F%2BSn5Ll59UmcbLTlOtafZMnOw9Gza2WLAGFNeYDYTlbU69qh8dHIchL8qvnJYKo%2FQCDogWCrqSxDXbK6UhVie%2FDCCZAk7rpWGysDaXqnAhGbJHKKp%2FAG49FSUzm%2F4yBZcW8NWcWKxEwLxjvTtsx%2B%2BRU4sKGgrQtDMR%2FHvkSrW7qTD7Ob%2B4u%2BXHz%2B3aIjYAe4TO%2B6iDdcEyrtRXavPYllN7yQcEHNPeQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":0,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 10 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-10T18:30:00.000Z","link":"https://www.myvue.com//book-tickets/summary/10009/HO00020100/285077","venue_name":"Vue Cardiff"}]}]},{"title":"THE CHOSEN: LAST SUPPER PART 1","description":"Jesus rides into the holy city as king, but finds his Father’s house has been turned from a place of prayer into a corrupt market.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":104,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"FRI 11 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-11T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292054&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles.

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":104,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 12 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-12T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292055&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SAT 12 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-12T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291262&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-12T13:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75997"},{"time":"2025-04-12T16:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Odeon Cardiff","link":"https://www.odeon.co.uk/ticketing/seat-picker/?showtimeId=954-75998"},{"time":"2025-04-12T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291263&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!

Macdonald’s riveting documentary takes that legendary musical event and uses it as the starting point to explore eighteen defining months in the lives of John and Yoko. By 1971 the couple was newly arrived in the United States— living in a tiny apartment in Greenwich Village and watching a huge amount of American television. The film uses a riotous mélange of American TV to conjure the era through what the two would have been seeing on the screen: the Vietnam War, The Price is Right, Nixon, Coca-Cola ads, Cronkite, The Waltons. As they experience a year of love and transformation in the US, John and Yoko begin to change their approach to protest  — ultimately leading to the One to One concert, which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera exposé they watched on TV. Filmed in a meticulously faithful reproduction of the NYC apartment the duo shared, ONE TO ONE: JOHN & YOKO offers a bold new take on a seminal time in the lives of two of history’s most influential artists. \n","rating":"TBC","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/ONETOONE%3AJOHN%26YOKO.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=AU81oiiTS5TUD2Xx%2FaMbB9wHH8NP%2FwPF1JSr%2BVxsqR3yNfTxBECVk%2FM3DeSFBrdJEv27ZUNkRhjJRBFbU9QM8LSza6RO%2FFP9WzvTKCfeUOVsRlqTZcxjo7deLKQU%2Fm6Bb2G8wmIp4KnwwhVtrAAZX2RdXXFo7rA9ITBMpo3xP02%2FupEBi2f7LI401aXWFKxBApqnfiD9ZibboPVmOVnZvgyA13wP7N90BbkV17AYMQLlq3AnPgLgvdvltgmM1JGgo8FH3%2FtIS9Zq3UjcdVdVocOm84sRjCJDfaHM%2B4zTsljz7vqX5FX6e6SWlBCdxaCVFPamFzAUvwaEcb9CCYQUdQ%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":104,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"SUN 13 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-13T18:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=292056&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens – Jarnéia Richard-Noel, Millie O'Connell, Natalie Paris, Alexia McIntosh, Aimie Atkinson and Maiya Quansah-Breed - each reprising their roles for a one-off, showstopping cinematic experience.\n\nWatched by audiences of over 3.5 million, the box office smash-hit and double TONY award-winning SIX the Musical has reigned supreme as a global theatre phenomenon since its 2017 debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione Orrom.\n","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=H%2FyRQChcP2l4tn4mg%2Bo1F0Bh3OjxTmgvV7PP%2BzUgA%2Bm9qNZe7mU1wGiUmX%2BszpxnEBktIAAS6z6TBfoIS0phlqfI9EESACQgK%2Biq%2F7P4qAc8z8neIU2WR62sJpzbfz3Enl989isTF9Z14TNMCwxPG6qCfu3yusSdSm6rgXGeXbxKTv6DrEZH0Vwjeti1W2BzeD5Y2LLFRdH4Hqj3f%2B4hdKPD6tr0Immylk6XBu0wLVM7s6g7RUk353gGWsp1DdmrF%2FWTql1VtInMKrT5MFZ7aH0cstSlR7byVySGQfwqGinzOzyzqyp10lZQw67NoRLQZSVXJa4XPS6IJ7YDDrE%2BBw%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 15 APR","screenings":[{"time":"2025-04-15T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291268&lang=en-GB"},{"time":"2025-04-15T17:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Cineworld Cardiff","link":"https://experience.cineworld.co.uk/select-tickets?sitecode=055&site=055&id=291269&lang=en-GB"}]}]},{"title":"SIX THE MUSICAL LIVE!","description":"Filmed at London’s Vaudeville Theatre, SIX the Musical Live!  features the six original West End queens.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/SIXTHEMUSICALLIVE%21.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=oZZrd819K%2FgH7Xg6J0uoy8l5n31NlHjUriZYZei42kpPnEWOJYGuXzhNgvWym%2FWpg4Xla%2Bt3co5S2yGcs%2FLH7TRHYc%2BlDOwJdQ%2FQqE9G1qJwalmaOna76wlkl3DNpIimuBuS9eApaWvABVcvQo22tex0GJP%2FXa%2FnqemDAkO7Zu4oqeS6H4RGBpN4%2Bw%2FzQHJzkXfwFu7jTfXFnu78i%2F8ZH4e3%2BNLx7Ceqab9dJa38um5atjBjUwUabQuPvVVWFa6uU1CrTo9rPcBinxm7%2FyFZ0k8%2BrZ5jXlwN6yZ44GRvQguc%2F%2Fpi9gJ9j8BI%2FVDTGjdXzz9VaH53wiu0XdGYP9llMg%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":95,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 15 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-15T13:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148487"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-15T15:15:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/148488"}]}]},{"title":"THE AMATEUR","description":"When a CIA cryptographer discovers that terrorists were behind his fiancée's death in a suspicious plane crash, he receives special training in order to plot his revenge.","rating":"12A","image_link":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cinema-viewer1.appspot.com/filmPosters/THEAMATEUR.jpg?GoogleAccessId=firebase-adminsdk-lf2hl%40cinema-viewer1.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=16731014400&Signature=Iv%2FVrrxt2%2BQ5jPjKlei0nsCCq9E20Hqc2snc5DNYbxS0zBFkiohVihke%2BNGr9mhKrYFKPbrEra13lO7E7xrAtFWFDnrgTE6ANbWeXa1L3P9zxR45kIVLtWm6E9t6lTeKLdtmNLnlW%2FcmgDZu%2BLZaj6LUj4vrpTvn%2F407nipvG%2FlLOT0wqU%2FW8p3VwiSrG2riU5zJkqEpYPDvo4mi0MkD0AQmcDKu%2FIsyCh23LQgDEICXlQcQAu0UQWOAgxZ4gYuZ%2FdzPQYHl%2F05e0%2BDPenK2F4OSZFLGXJeLYZFDH8oYNc9Dlq1Bacl2EEZiIswkqguYPc2a9sX%2BW3dOjdKpihYAkA%3D%3D","length_in_minutes":123,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 15 APR","screenings":[{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-15T10:00:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/150204"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-15T12:55:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/150205"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-15T15:45:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/150206"},{"venue_name":"Showcase Cardiff Nantgarw","time":"2025-04-15T18:35:00.000Z","link":"https://tickets.showcasecinemas.co.uk/startticketing/0114/150207"}]}]},{"title":"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS","description":"FBI trainee Clarice Starling is assigned to interview the brilliant but imprisoned psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, in hopes of gaining insight into an active case.

A heavily muscled construction worker, he boasts a beautiful wife, Lori, good friends, and a technologically advanced home featuring video phones and even video walls. But he is haunted by dreams of a mysterious brunette woman and the red wastelands of Mars. Quaid visits Rekall, a unique travel agency that implants the memory of an adventure into its customers' minds, to get the chance to live out his Martian fantasies. When something goes terribly wrong and a blocked off portion of his mind is activated, Quaid finds himself at the center of a dangerous conspiracy.

With 5* reviews from the Telegraph, Express, Sunday Mirror, Evening Standard and more, the electrifying show follows the long-misunderstood wives of Henry VIII as they strut out of the shadow of their infamous husband to reclaim their narrative and finally tell their stories in their own words - with plenty of royally good fun along the way. \n\nWritten by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, this musical for the ages sees the six queens - Catherine of Aragon (Richard-Noel), Anne Boleyn (O’Connell), Jane Seymour (Paris), Anna of Cleves (McIntosh), Katherine Howard (Atkinson) and Catherine Parr (Quansah-Breed) - take back the microphone through a series of infectious, empowering performances. The queens are accompanied by the sensational on-stage band, the Ladies in Waiting. \n\nSIX the Musical Live! was recorded at the Vaudeville Theatre, London with the original cast reprising their roles. The show was directed for stage by Lucy Moss & Jamie Armitage and directed for film by Liz Clare, and produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy & Andy Barnes, George Stiles and Dione

Set in the hauntingly beautiful ruins of the ancient Roman Amphitheater in Pompeii, Italy, the film captures Pink Floyd performing an intimate concert without an audience. Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. This meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release. Inspired by the golden warmth of Pompeii’s iconic setting, the remaster transforms this timeless piece into a masterpiece of sight and sound.

Set in the hauntingly beautiful ruins of the ancient Roman Amphitheater in Pompeii, Italy, the film captures Pink Floyd performing an intimate concert without an audience. Filmed in October 1971, the performance features unforgettable tracks such as “Echoes,” “A Saucerful of Secrets,” and “One of These Days.” The breathtaking visuals of the amphitheater, captured both day and night, amplify the magic of the performance, creating a unique and immersive experience. Additionally, the film includes rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. This meticulous restoration delivers stunning image and sound quality, featuring a theatrical and home entertainment mix from Steven Wilson in 5.1 and Dolby Atmos. These upgrades enhance the film's depth and clarity while preserving the authenticity and spirit of the original 1972 release. Inspired by the golden warmth of Pompeii’s iconic setting, the remaster transforms this timeless piece into a masterpiece of sight and sound.

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"TUE 20 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-20T17:30:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37640"}]}]},{"title":"ROYAL BALLET AND OPERA: DIE WALKÜRE","description":"On a stormy night, fate brings two strangers together, unleashing a love with the power to end worlds.

Michelangelo’s genius is evident in everything he touched. Beautiful and diverse works such as the towering statue of David, the moving Pietà in the Papal Basilica of St. Peter and his tour-de-force, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, still leave us breathless today.\n\nSpanning his 88 years, Michelangelo - Love and Death takes a cinematic journey through the print and drawing rooms of Europe through the great chapels and museums of Florence, Rome and the Vatican to seek out a deeper understanding of this legendary figure’s tempestuous life, his relationship with his contemporaries and his incredible legacy.\n\nThrough expert commentary, stunning visuals and Michelangelo’s own words, this film takes a fresh look at a master artist whose life and genius are celebrated in every mark he made. Returning to cinemas in 2025 to celebrate this iconic artist’s 550th birthday.\n\nSculptor, painter, architect, poet, genius - discover why Michelangelo is without a doubt one of the greatest artists of all time.","rating":"PG","image_link":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkMzY2MWQtNDM4Ny00NzU4LWJlNGUtMDljYWIyMzFiYTg2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg","length_in_minutes":91,"screenings_data":[{"screenings_date_label":"THU 22 MAY","screenings":[{"time":"2025-05-22T12:00:00.000Z","venue_name":"Everyman Cardiff","link":"https://purchase.everymancinema.com/startticketing/1039/37639"}]}]},{"title":"RBO: BALLET TO BROADWAY: WHEELDON WORKS","description":"Sensuous contemporary ballet meets the energy of musical theatre in four distinctive short works.
